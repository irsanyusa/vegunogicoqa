The omicron variant, she said, has had little impact thus far.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“For each COVID case surge that we've seen, people have become more resilient over time, so sentiment has fallen less for each of those surges,” Bruun said. “That's a positive sign in terms of people's willingness to still go out and spend on discretionary categories in general.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Bruun also pointed out that the labor picture has improved over the past few months, which could result in more discretionary spending in the near future.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“The employment to population ratio overall has been rising,” she said, “so that means more people earning wages, higher incomes and more ability to spend.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite the uncertain picture as winter starts, Andersen projected that pent-up demand for going out and being around other people will drive a ticket sales resurgence in the spring, specifically citing baseball teams as beneficiaries.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Most importantly, she is confident that the live events industry will do everything in its power to avoid shutting back down.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“What I can tell you is that the doors are open, and we're doing it,” Andersen said. “We're not going back.
