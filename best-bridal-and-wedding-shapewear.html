A great shapewear undergarment enhances your own natural shape while providing compression and support. Just as there are no rules or restrictions as to what your wedding dress should look like, there is no shapewear that provides the perfect solution for every person. You’ll likely need to try on a variety of pieces in a range of styles to figure out the optimal choice for you. However, if you know what you want to achieve with shapewear—tummy control, a cinched waist, etc.—it’s easier to find a good option online. To help you get started, I’m drawing upon my 30+ years of experience as a tailor and stylist in the bridal, fashion, film and television businesses and sharing other ways to know you’ve found the right shapewear for your special day.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-best-bridal-and-wedding-shapewear>Our top picks for best bridal and wedding shapewear</h2><h3>Best shapewear for comfort: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Spanx Invisible Shaping High-Waisted Mid-Thigh Short</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best shapewear for comfort</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Spanx Invisible Shaping High-Waisted Mid-Thigh Short</h3></p><p>In my 30 plus years of tailoring and altering dresses for brides, actresses, and other performers, these mid-thigh, high waisted Thinstincts shorts from Spanx consistently receive the highest praise for both their comfort and contouring properties. (Spanx also made our list of the <a rel=alternate href=#>best shapewear for women</a>.) Made with single layer “Printed Power” shaping technology, you’ll marvel at how something so lightweight can provide such support and compression. They also feature free cut hems and minimal seams that create no visible lines.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Sizes: XS-3X</li><li>Compression Level: medium support with firm compression</li><li>Material: nylon, Lycra elastane, cotton gusset</li><li>Gusset type: cotton</li><li>Colors: black, champaign, au-lait, brown</li><li>Price on Publish: $72.00</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Thin fabric</li><li>High waisted</li><li>Excellent compression</li></ul><h4 class=title>What we don't Like:</h4><ul><li>Too long for shorter dress styles</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>High waisted, from compression, mid-thigh shorts from Spanx made with a thin, yet supportive material.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a rel=nofollow href=#>Spanx Invisible Shaping High-Waisted Mid-Thigh Short</a></p><h3>Best corset shapewear: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Skims Waist Trainer</a></h3><p><span class=best-for>Best corset shapewear</span></p><p><h3 class=title>SKIMS Waist Trainer | Light Neutral | 4XL | Neoprene Shapewear</h3></p><p>If your main objective is to cinch in your waist à la the corsets of yore, the Skims waist trainer gets the job done without all the lacing and unlacing (that requires the assistance of another person). Unlike traditional corsets, it's fashioned from an ultra-thin high-tech neoprene that renders it undetectable under most everything. Note that it may require some struggling to get it on (maybe you do need a helper after all), but once situated, it’s comfortable enough to wear all day.

I have fit literally hundreds of people in all sorts of wedding dresses, from slinky bias-cut gowns to strapless ones with tight bodices and full skirts and everything in between (I once created a dress with a zip-off bottom so a bride could go from wedding ceremony to the dance reception with ease).</p><p>I also consulted online reviews, considering style, fabric, and quality, to put together this list of the best options for a range of styles.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-bridal-and-wedding-shapewear>What to consider when buying Bridal and Wedding Shapewear</h2><h3>Style</h3><p>The style of your shapewear should match that of your dress and, above all, should lay flat under it in the most unobtrusive way possible. You don’t want anyone to know you’re wearing shapewear, after all. Once you’ve settled on a dress, you may have to try on multiple options to achieve the best effect. Style elements of your dress that help determine which shapewear to choose include necklines, whether or not it's strapless, and how form fitting your gown is. Many people, at minimum, want tummy control shapewear.</p><h3>Compression</h3><p>Shapewear comes in a range of firmnesses, from light to extra firm. If you’re not used to wearing shapewear you may want to consider something with a lighter compression. Extra firm garments really do suck you in, and some people find them uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time.</p><p>That being said, it’s a great idea to don your shapewear under regular clothes and go about your day to see how it feels. Once people get used to a certain level of compression, they can usually wear it all day long without really noticing it’s there.</p><h3>Color options</h3><p>Skims offers the widest range of styles and colors of shapewear, including a diverse set of skin tones. Choosing shapewear that mimics as closely as possible your own skin tone is ideal as these will be the most invisible under thin fabrics. While a wedding dress is traditionally white, white shapewear isn’t always advisable because you may be able to see the color transition from it to bare skin.</p><h3>Ease of use</h3><p>Consider also how difficult it is to get in and out of your shapewear (sometimes pulling on a pair can feel like a full-blown workout). Look for garments that feature open or hook and eye gussets that will make bathroom trips easy. Which you prefer is really a personal preference. Again, I recommend taking your shapewear out for a few trial runs before the big day.</p><h2 id=how-to-clean-bridal-and-wedding-shapewear>How to clean bridal and wedding shapewear</h2><p>Refrain from ever tossing your shapewear into the dryer (always hang dry). Dryer heat will shrink and possibly damage the nylon and/or elastane used to construct most shapewear. If your washing machine possesses a truly “delicate” or hand wash cycle, it’s safe for washing but be sure to use cold water and a delicate laundry detergent such as <a rel=nofollow href=#>Woolite</a>. Hand washing is always a safe alternative option.</p><h2 id=comfort-fit-and-design>Comfort, fit, and design</h2><p>Features that will contribute to the comfort of your bridal and wedding shapewear include cotton gussets with hook and eye openings or a fold-over design to make going to the bathroom easier. Also, look for seamless options made from thin fabrics that will make them less noticeable under silky, body-skimming dresses.</p><p>Pay attention to necklines; many bridal dresses feature plunging fronts or low back styles and you don’t want your shapewear peeking out. I suggest staying away from anything with lace inserts, as no matter how pretty the lace is, it can still cause bumpiness when worn under many dresses. Look for shapewear that is as smooth as possible.</p><p>Bodysuits with adjustable straps provide a great versatile option that will allow you to pair it with a range of dresses (instead of just one specific gown).</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Are you supposed to wear shapewear under a wedding dress?</h3><p>You’re not necessarily “supposed” to (it’s your wedding day and you can do what you want) but many people like the smoothing and contouring aspects of a quality shapewear garment. Certain dress styles may fit better with shapewear under them, especially fitted or body-skimming styles.</p><h3>How can I flatten my stomach under my wedding dress?</h3><p>High-waisted firm compression shorts, bodysuits, or even a waist cincher will all flatten your stomach under your wedding dress. Make sure to try your dress on with multiple undergarment options to achieve the silhouette that works best for you.</p><h3>What type of shapewear do most brides wear under their dress?</h3><p>Most brides wear something that smooths out their stomach, hips, and back. From there, options vary depending on personal preference for the amount of compression, bust size, and whether or not they want thigh compression. Spanx high-waisted shorts are always a popular option; they smooth the upper thighs, butt, and tummy, and tuck in under your bra.</p><h3>What to look for in wedding dress shapewear?</h3><p>Look for shapewear made from high quality thin materials. If you’re going the bodysuit route, pay attention to what sort of gusset it has. An open gusset or one with a hook and eye closure will make your life much easier. Also, consider options with adjustable straps and a low neckline, as this will mean they’ll likely work under a wider range of different dresses.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lkqe2pa3LZpinnF2ssqWwyKeeZquYlr2mw8SaqWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
