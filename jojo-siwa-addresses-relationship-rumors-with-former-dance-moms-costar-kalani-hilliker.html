Since then, their incredibly close bond and flirty banter have fueled speculation that they are more than just friends. However, both women wanted to set the record straight about the real nature of their relationship.</p><p>“The world thinks I have the biggest crush on you,” Siwa said. “I love you with my whole heart. You are one of the hottest women in the world. I see your pictures and I’m like, ‘Yes, b*tch, you better work.’ You could not be further from my type.”</p><p>Hilliker echoed the sentiment, confirming she does not have romantic feelings for Siwa either. “You’re not my type either.”</p><p>She then went on to explain that while she adores Siwa, she sees her strictly as a sister, nothing more. The two admitted that they understand why some fans may have gotten the wrong idea about their relationship. Pointing to moments captured on camera for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dance Moms</a> where Siwa seemed fixated on Hilliker.</p><p>“Seeing the picture from the Teen Choice Awards where I’m staring at you, I understand why the rumor started. It so looks like it’s so funny.” Siwa said.</p><p>But the longtime friends wanted to set the record straight once and for all that despite their flirty banter and close bond, romance has never been a factor in their friendship.</p><a title=@jojosiwanowpodcast href=# rel=noopener>@jojosiwanowpodcast</a><p>JoJo FINALLY answers the question you have all been waiting for…listen to the full episode with Kalani🤍Link in the bio🎙️ @itsjojosiwa @kalanihilliker</p><a title="♬ original sound - JoJo Siwa Now Podcast" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – JoJo Siwa Now Podcast</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-siwa-opens-up-about-insecurities-hair-loss>JoJo Siwa Opens Up About Insecurities, Hair Loss</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Siwa</a> recently got candid about the difficulties of growing up in the spotlight. In a tearful moment on the reality competition show Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test, Siwa opened up about being “very hard” on herself and having insecurities.</p><p>“Growing up in front of the internet, it’s the hardest thing. Everything gets judged,” Siwa said. “You know, people told me I have a receding hairline. They don’t know that I have a stress rash and that’s why I’m balding right here.”</p><p>Siwa’s raw honesty struck a chord with many fans who could relate to her struggles. Though the former Dance Moms star has built an impressive career and amassed an enormous fanbase, she admits that doesn’t make her immune to hurtful remarks. “I’m very hard on myself. I judge myself in everything. I am a very insecure person,” she confessed.</p><p>Siwa’s candid revelations provide rare insight into the challenges of growing up in the public eye. While her larger-than-life persona radiates confidence, she’s clearly grappling with personal struggles behind the scenes.</p><a title=@itsjojosiwa href=# rel=noopener>@itsjojosiwa</a><p>The hardest day of my life by far was day 6 of Special Forces. Emotionally. This is just a small part of day 6…. This is me on day 6… I got pulled into the mirror room and I admitted things to DS Foxy and DS Q that I had never said out loud to ANYONE before. It was the most intense, difficult, scary, emotional, vulnerable, and honest conversation I’ve ever had. This was the day I decided I would change the way I live. Having this life changing moment on display for the world is emotionally confusing, but I’m very grateful that it is ❤️‍🩹 Special Forces day 6 episode 6 tonight on fox 🤍</p><a title="♬ original sound - JoJo Siwa" href=# rel=noopener>♬ original sound – JoJo Siwa</a><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_LouisVanAmstel_Alberto-E.-RodriguezGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="‘DWTS’ Pro Louis Van Amstel Navigates Silent Divorce: “It’s Been Really Tough”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWjnsSiecCdm6udo6iytHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlkq62dpL%2B0edaiq6FllqS%2FrrHRZpuappOaeq67zKxknKejqa6zecqao5qmmWK1qrjLoqKeql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
