With star power like that, this season is shaping up to be jaw-dropping. And one of the first performances “leaked” from the premiere was the Gazelle.</strong></p><p>But who is the celebrity under the mask? And why is her voice so recognizable? Here’s everything we know and our maybe way too early prediction!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Gazelle performs “Uninvited” by Alanis Morissette on The Masked Singer Season 10 Premiere</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 10</h2><p>Ahead of the premiere, we’ve gotten a few short clips of the Gazelle singing, along with a full performance of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“Uninvited” by Alanis Morissette</a>. We also got a first clue about her identity in the season 10 kickoff. She said, “if you can remember the A-list celebrity who donned this mask in season 4, that’s your first clue to my identity” while showing a framed picture of the <a href=#>Gremlin</a>. To refresh your memory, the Gremlin was unmasked to be Mickey Rourke.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE MASKED SINGER’ SEASON 10 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><p>In the premiere episode, we learned a lot more about the Gazelle. Her clues started with her saying that she “saw a Broadway show at 6 and fell in love with performing.” She walked up to a sign that said “Hello Doll! Starring Gazelle” on it. The Gazelle went on to say that when she was a teenager, she took a huge chance and performed in a national talent competition, but that she “crashed and burned.” We see a “judge” boo in a Hawaiian shirt.</p><p>Next, the Gazelle talks about how music was her “first love.” We saw three golden bulldog statues and one of the judges mentioned that may be a nod to Georgia, whose university mascot is a bulldog. We also saw a shot of cheerleading pom poms during her clues. After Gazelle’s performance, we saw a vinyl record that had “Movie Soundtrack” printed on it. She explained that she “acts and sings in movies.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Gazelle</h2><p>The judges predicted that the celebrity under the Gazelle mask could be Camila Mendes, Lucy Hale, or Vanessa Hudgens. Fans online are making bold predictions based on her performance and clues too. The most popular guesses are Evan Rachel Wood, Idina Menzel, Diana DeGarmo, and Carrie Underwood. But by far the most widely accepted prediction is Idina Menzel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Gazelle on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>The Gazelle clearly has an amazing voice! And all the clues line up perfectly for her to be…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-janel-parrish>Janel Parrish!</h3><p>And here’s how the clues prove it. Before the season, we learned the Gazelle had a connection to Mickey Rourke and Janel was in the movie “Tiger” with him. Then in her clues, we saw a “Hello Doll” poster, an obvious nod to her role in the Bratz movie based on the doll franchise.&nbsp;This also explains her movie soundtrack clue, because she sang on the soundtrack for Bratz, as well as some of her movies including Adventures in Appleton, April Showers, and Triple Dog.</p><p>The Gazelle said that she saw a Broadway show at 6 years old that made her fall in love with performing. Janel has said that same thing about seeing Phantom of the Opera at the same age. Next, when she was a teenager, she performed in a national talent competition. Janel Parrish was on Star Search when she was 14 but didn’t make it past her first performance.</p><p>We’ve seen a Hawaiian shirt and a surfboard, and Janel is from Hawaii. The clues also showed pom moms, and she made a guest appearance as a cheerleader in an episode of “Drop Dead Diva” on Lifetime, and three golden bulldogs, which allude to the movie she was in called “Triple Dog.”&nbsp;</p><p>The only way to know if we’re right is to watch The Masked Singer Wednesday nights on FOX!
