In a new report from the outlet, a source reveals the coaches’ alleged paychecks for Season 25 of the singing competition.</p><p>The source shared that McEntire, Legend, and Dan + Shay are getting paid $13 million for this season, which they described as “the higher end of the fee range for talent” on the network. Chance the Rapper, on the other hand, is reportedly making $8 million.</p><p>The Sun compared these figures to past coach salaries, pointing out that Shelton previously made $13 million per season when he was a coach, as did his wife Gwen Stefani. Coaches Niall Horan and Camila Cabello reportedly earned the $8 million sum.</p><p>The highest-paid coaches throughout the series include Kelly Clarkson — who allegedly made $15 million — and Ariana Grande, who was reported to have made between $20 million and $25 million for her season.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE VOICE’ SEASON 25 BATTLES BEGIN WITH STEALS AND PLAYOFF PASSES</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-new-season-is-currently-airing>The New Season Is Currently Airing</h2><p>The new season of The Voice is currently airing on NBC, as the coaches hone their teams before the live shows kick off.

Legend is the longest-running coach on the panel, having appeared in nine seasons. McEntire got her start last season, replacing longtime coach Blake Shelton. Chance the Rapper is returning for a second season after making his debut in Season 23.</p><p>Dan + Shay are newcomers this season, as the show introduced its very first coaching duo.
