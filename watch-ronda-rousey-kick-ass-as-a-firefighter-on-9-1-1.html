Still, the series somehow maintains its special form of realism, and we're digging its new female star. She's as tough as the ferris wheel-riding character she plays.</p><p>You might remember that Rousey <a href=# id=205f2d83-984b-3080-a8d0-bf7f497fca80>almost lost her fingers</a> filming for the series this summer. She was told to open a cabin door aboard a yacht and charge out. Camera rolling, Rousey opened the door, simultaneously moving her other hand to the frame. But as she opened the door, her hand positioned by the hinge, the door pinched her finger, nearly severing it. Rousey finished the scene before heading to the hospital where they re-attached her bone and tendon with a plate and screws. (Rouseys range of motion slowly returned, and she was able to keep shooting the rest of the week. In her Instagram, she said simply, modern medicine amazes me.)</p><p>Co-created by Ryan Murphy (Glee, Pose, American Horror Story), 9-1-1 chronicles the day-to-day experiences of L.A.s first responders. Rousey will play firefighter Lena Bosko for the remainder of season 3, which debuted two weeks ago. Bosko made her appearance during the series' Tsunami storyline, which the first three episodes comprise.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Rousey has appeared in a number of films including The Expendables 3, Furious 7, and Mile 22. 9-1-1 marks Rouseys first recurring television role.</p><p>Of course, before all that, Rousey was a UFC champion and one of the most influential female athletes of the last decade, helping bring larger audiences into womens mixed martial arts. Rousey became the first female fighter to sign with the UFC in 2012. She was a six-time reigning UFC Womens Bantamweight Champion before her loss to Holly Holm in 2015, Rouseys first professional loss. A year later, after the loss to Amanda Nunes, Rousey stepped away from MMA. In 2018 she signed with WWE and went on to become the longest-reigning Raw Womens Champion.</p><p>Shell continue to kick ass and fight through pain (both fictitious, and, apparently, yacht-cabin-door real) for the remainder of the season. No word yet on Season 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZLqmutJmn56ZnKm1cMPArZqhZaKku6WtjKumrquVrnqstcKkZJqro2KutHnAZp2iqpWbtqi0056pZqeeYoZufYxqZqSenqbEtK8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
