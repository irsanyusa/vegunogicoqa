It’s instantly recognizable and difficult to replicate. From the twang of Texas to the smooth drawl of the Atlantic coast, the Southern accent is expressive and colorful.&nbsp;</p><p>This article will cover the origins of the Southern accent, different types and helpful grammar and pronunciation.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Why-is-there-a-Southern-accent?>Why is there a Southern accent?</h2><p>Sometimes the Southern accent is called a “country accent” to imply its rural or working-class nature. For non-Southerners, the Southern accent can be perceived as uneducated or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“bad” English</a>.&nbsp; Actually, the Southern accent comes directly from <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">British Received Pronunciation</a> and aristocratic society.</p><p>The American South extends over a huge area from Maryland in the north to Florida in the south and Texas in the west. The South represents 16 (of 50) US states and has a population of nearly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">130 million</a> people. It also includes the nation’s capital, Washington D.C.</p><p>The first British colony in America was established in 1607 in Virginia. These Southern colonies quickly grew wealthy from crops such as tobacco and cotton. This wealth created a rich, upper class. They wanted to mimic the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">posh British accent</a> as a sign of their wealth and status. This meant dropping r’s and elongating vowels. Over time, the Southern accent slowed down and developed its own flavor.</p><p>Immigration and the trafficking of enslaved people to the American South also influenced accents. New Orleans, for example, was at different times a French and Spanish colony. Enslaved people from various parts of Africa developed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">pidgins and creoles</a> in order to communicate across different languages. There is a connection between <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">African American Vernacular English</a> and the Southern accent due to this history of forced labor in Southern plantations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Types-of-Southern-accents>Types of Southern accents</h2><p>There are a few unique Southern accents because the American South is so large. You probably know famous superstars from different parts of the South. Here’s an introduction to the major types of Southern accents.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Atlantic</h3><p>This is what most people think of as the “US southern accent.” It has been mimicked in famous movies such as Gone with the Wind. You’ll hear this southern accent spoken in Virginia, Maryland, the Carolinas and parts of Georgia.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Appalachian Southern</h3><p>This part of the mountainous region following the Ohio river touches parts of many states like Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi and Alabama. Here, they pronounce the r’s rather than drop them. Due to Irish and Scottish immigrants, there is unique pronunciation here like h-dropping.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Mississippi Delta</h3><p>Famous people with accents from the Mississippi Delta include <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Johnny Cash</a> and Britney Spears. It also includes a very unique accent from New Orleans.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Texas</h3><p>The Texas accent along with the Atlantic region are probably the most recognizable Southern accents. It’s nasal, twangy and personified in the actor Mathew McConaughey.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-do-a-Southern-accent>How to do a Southern accent</h2><p>So, how do Southerners speak?
