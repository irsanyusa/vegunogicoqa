Bright Side thinks that we ought to learn some upbringing tricks from Japanese parents. So we’ve collected the main principles of raising children in Japan.
The mother-child relationship is tight.
In Japan, the connection between a mother and her child is really strong. They sleep together and mothers always carry their kids around with them — in the past, mothers would use something resembling a baby sling."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Foreigners see this as&nbsp;permissiveness and overindulgence but they’re mistaken. This principle lets children know that they’re good.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/153/421/7deb5e52689dc44c928838eabf.jpg><p>Japanese artists’ works from the end of&nbsp;the 17th century&nbsp;/ the beginning of&nbsp;the 18th century. On&nbsp;the right, you can see a&nbsp;mother and her child enjoying goldfish.</p><p>Such an&nbsp;attitude contributes to&nbsp;“amae.” This word has no&nbsp;analogs in&nbsp;other languages, but it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;translated as&nbsp;“one’s desire to&nbsp;be&nbsp;loved” or&nbsp;simply “attachment”. “Amae” is&nbsp;the foundation of&nbsp;relationships between mothers and children. It&nbsp;means that children can rely on&nbsp;their parents and their love, and elderly parents receive their adult children’s support.</p><p>There was a<a href=#>&nbsp;study</a> conducted by&nbsp;American and Japanese scientists that proves there’s a&nbsp;<strong>connection between an&nbsp;encouraging upbringing style and children’s behavior.</strong> Researchers claim that parents’ positive attitudes reduce the risk of&nbsp;problematic behavior in&nbsp;kids and improve the behavior of&nbsp;children with developmental disorders.</p><p><h2>The Japanese upbringing system</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/107/1e5/13a1af5c32955703f242f5e764.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>All people are created equal. Japanese princess, Ayako (the second on&nbsp;the right) is&nbsp;performing with classmates during an&nbsp;athletic festival in&nbsp;Tokyo.</p><p>According to&nbsp;the famous Japanese system of&nbsp;upbringing, children are perfect before they turn&nbsp;5, are like servants from age 5&nbsp;to&nbsp;15, and are considered equal to&nbsp;their parents and other people by&nbsp;age 15. But many foreigners don’t understand this way of&nbsp;thinking and interpret it&nbsp;incorrectly.</p><p>This philosophy is&nbsp;aimed at&nbsp;raising a&nbsp;member of&nbsp;a&nbsp;collective society where personal interests aren’t the most important thing. It’s a&nbsp;kind of&nbsp;stress and Japanese parents try to&nbsp;raise a&nbsp;harmonious person who will be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;find their purpose and won’t underestimate their own value.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/384/9d8/d76cd25099b41454839528da47.jpg><p><strong>In&nbsp;the first stage,</strong> parents share endless love and care with their children.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;the second stage, </strong>their love doesn’t vanish. A&nbsp;child learns to&nbsp;live by&nbsp;the rules of&nbsp;society and tries to&nbsp;find their purpose in&nbsp;this world. Since the mother-child attachment is&nbsp;really strong, a&nbsp;child tries to&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything right as&nbsp;not to&nbsp;upset their mom.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;the third stage, </strong>a&nbsp;child becomes a&nbsp;full member of&nbsp;society.</p><p><h2>The family is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most significant things.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6ce/0f4/fda88b5914b5ff62be154b24c5.png><p class=adme-img-description>Girls wearing traditional kimonos during <a href=#>Shichi-Go-San</a>, a&nbsp;rite of&nbsp;passage and festival for children.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, mothers raise children. They spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time together: Japanese people think children shouldn’t be&nbsp;sent to&nbsp;kindergarten before they turn 3&nbsp;years old. Parents don’t usually ask grandparents to&nbsp;babysit their children and don’t hire babysitters.</p><p>But children spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time with grandparents and other relatives. Their relationships with <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> members are really warm and caring. Families consist of&nbsp;people who will always support and protect each other.</p><p><h2>Parents are role models.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe8/259/879f365fe9a63ef65571c20d75.jpg><p>There was an&nbsp;experiment that involved Japanese and European moms. They were asked to&nbsp;construct a&nbsp;pyramid. Japanese moms built the pyramid on&nbsp;their own and then asked their children to&nbsp;repeat&nbsp;it. If&nbsp;children failed to&nbsp;build&nbsp;it, they started constructing the pyramid all over again.</p><p>European moms explained how to&nbsp;build the pyramid and asked their children to&nbsp;try. So&nbsp;the mothers from Japan followed the rule “do&nbsp;it&nbsp;the way I&nbsp;do,” and the mothers from Europe offered their children to&nbsp;do&nbsp;everything on&nbsp;their own and didn’t provide an&nbsp;example.</p><p>Japanese mothers don’t make children do&nbsp;things they’re requested to&nbsp;do. They give an&nbsp;example and show the way things have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;done.</p><p><h2>Paying attention to&nbsp;emotions</h2></p><p><strong>To&nbsp;teach a&nbsp;child to&nbsp;live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;collective society, it’s important to&nbsp;teach them to&nbsp;“see” and respect other’s feelings and interests.</strong></p><p>Japanese mothers respect their children’s feelings: they don’t push them or&nbsp;make them feel ashamed or&nbsp;embarrassed. They teach them to&nbsp;understand the emotions of&nbsp;other people and even inanimate objects. For example, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid is&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;break their toy car, a&nbsp;mom from Japan will say, “Poor car, it’s going to&nbsp;cry.” A&nbsp;European mom will probably rebuke, “Stop it. It’s bad.”</p><p>Japanese people don’t claim that their methods are the best. Today, Western values also influence their traditions. But major concepts of&nbsp;Japan, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>calm and loving attitude toward children</strong> are unchanging.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you agree with the Japanese upbringing philosophy?
