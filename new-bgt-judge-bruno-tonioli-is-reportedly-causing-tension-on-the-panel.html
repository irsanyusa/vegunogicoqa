A new report reveals that Tonioli hit the Golden Buzzer for a second time</strong> <strong>during the current taping for Series 16.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bgt-judge-bruno-tonioli-reportedly-hits-golden-buzzer-twice>BGT Judge Bruno Tonioli Reportedly Hits Golden Buzzer Twice</h2><p>Tonioli already caused some stress last week when he reportedly <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hit his Golden Buzzer</a> while an act was still performing. Now <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Sun</a> reports that he hit the Golden Buzzer for a second act, which is against the rules. (Each judge gets one Golden Buzzer.)</p><p>“It was madness. The buzzer worked but there was no glitter in the cannon above the stage as it had already been used up,” a source told the outlet. “A producer raced over to try to tell Bruno he couldn’t do that. Then there were discussions with the top execs and Simon, who had his head in his hands.”</p><p>Cowell and production company Fremantle reportedly decided to let the contestant through. According to the source, Tonioli explained that he had never watched BGT before, as he “didn’t want to be influenced by other shows’ judging styles.”</p><p>Apparently, Tonioli’s flubs don’t bother the show’s crowd, as the source said, “Fortunately the audience love him and just laugh at his blundering.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘DWTS’ JUDGE BRUNO TONIOLI TO REPLACE DAVID WALLIAMS ON ‘BGT’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-alesha-dixon-says-she-misses-david-walliams>Alesha Dixon Says She Misses David Walliams</h2><p>Last week, BGT judge Alesha Dixon took to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram stories</a> to share a photo of herself with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">former judge David Walliams</a>. She wrote, “Thank you @dwalliams for 10 amazing years on @bgt. I love you very much and will miss your dearly.”</p><p>Dixon and Amanda Holden reportedly clashed with Tonioli during tapings, with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Sun</a> reporting that Dixon told Tonioli to sit down, eventually pushing him into his chair. She and Holden also reportedly took issue with Tonioli’s criticism of a choir.</p><p>“I’ve had so much fun, I’ve already been told off. I’m loving it!” Tonioli told the crowd, according to the outlet.</p><p>Before filming began, Dixon and Holden were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly unhappy</a> that Tonioli was receiving the same pay as them (an estimated £850,000) when he just joined the show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/TheMaskedSinger_AmberRiley-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Shares First Season Nine Promo" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>bruno tonioli</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zZ6uZpqXqXqrwcOgnGaaoqq7sHnTqKWip5yeeqq%2FjKucqaeiqbKluNhmmpqto567qHnTnqWsoZ%2BjerC6jK2fnmWglrumuI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
