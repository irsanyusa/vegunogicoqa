She was apparently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heartbroken</a>. Luckily, at&nbsp;only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>5&nbsp;days</a> old, she was adopted by&nbsp;loving parents, Junie and Jerry Chenoweth.</p><p><h2>Her parents were always open about the situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/28f/907/b107a75da1940dee68680e08b4.png><p>Her whole life, her adoption was never a&nbsp;secret, and her parents always <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discussed</a> it&nbsp;openly with the young Kristin. They used to&nbsp;say to&nbsp;her, “The lady that had you in&nbsp;her belly could not take care of&nbsp;you the way she wanted&nbsp;to, and she loved you so&nbsp;much.” In&nbsp;fact, they always <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>celebrated</a> her “gotcha day,” the date she was adopted, 5&nbsp;days after her birthday.</p><p><h2>Kristin and her parents are grateful for the adoption.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c1d/850/e28e2d5f0c97435f1310689f91.jpg><p>She has said that being adopted was one of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>best</a> things to&nbsp;ever happen to&nbsp;her. In&nbsp;fact, she is&nbsp;grateful to&nbsp;have had a&nbsp;birth mother who recognized that she wasn’t ready to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;mom. Kristin says, “I&nbsp;recognize how fortunate I&nbsp;am to&nbsp;have parents who love and support me&nbsp;unconditionally. The fact that they are not my&nbsp;biological parents does not change the fact that they are simply my&nbsp;parents.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bfb/bd6/73395752eea1073b3967545119.jpg><p>Kristin’s parents also feel so&nbsp;grateful to&nbsp;have her as&nbsp;their child. Her dad always used to&nbsp;say, “Man, did we&nbsp;win the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lottery</a>.” To&nbsp;which Kristin would reply, ’’No, I&nbsp;won the lottery!’’</p><p>Her mom always told Kristin that her birth mother “gave you life, but we&nbsp;get to&nbsp;<i>give</i> you a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>life.” She feels that her history has made her grow into a&nbsp;more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>empathetic</a> person, capable of&nbsp;seeing when people feel abandoned or&nbsp;are in&nbsp;pain.</p><p><h2>She recognizes the beauty of&nbsp;adopted families.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc4/1a0/cddb2b57b2aa101a33ba14e545.jpg><p>Kristin thinks that adopted families are beautiful because they are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chosen</a>. She counts herself lucky to&nbsp;have parents who chose to&nbsp;love and care for her when her birth mother couldn’t. She says, ’’I often say adoption is&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-circle blessing, and&nbsp;I truly believe&nbsp;it. Adopted children were not abandoned, we&nbsp;were chosen.’’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c0a/972/90b0e35664ad4e85fba22a8e59.jpg><p>Kristin knows that adoption has shaped who she is&nbsp;today and wants to&nbsp;share the beauty of&nbsp;adoption. When reflecting on&nbsp;her past, she asked herself the question, “What will I&nbsp;do with my&nbsp;love today?”</p><p>This is&nbsp;now the title of&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>children’s book</a>, which follows a&nbsp;young girl who adopts a&nbsp;lonely dog looking for a&nbsp;home. The book is&nbsp;partially based on&nbsp;her own history of&nbsp;being adopted. She hopes the message of&nbsp;love in&nbsp;her book will encourage people, saying, “Extra love in&nbsp;your <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heart</a> and your home is&nbsp;waiting for somebody who is&nbsp;all alone.”</p><p>What are you grateful for in&nbsp;your family? What do&nbsp;you think your children have taught you about life?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZutMCvnGavn6Oxpr7FrqNmqJGnsq%2FA0mauoaddmLWwv8RmpJ5lm6e2tMDIp2ScoJWjvLix06FkrKCRp7K0eceeqWaglZa%2FtcPAq6SippdirqW7z62gqKZdqMGwvthmb2luaGyCcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
