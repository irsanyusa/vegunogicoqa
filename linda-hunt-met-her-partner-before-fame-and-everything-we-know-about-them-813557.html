She met her true love when she was not yet famous and always considered herself as ’not beautiful or&nbsp;pretty.’ But we&nbsp;are here to&nbsp;say that she is&nbsp;more than just pretty. Let’s explore how her love life began and where she is&nbsp;now.</p><p><h2>The 78 -year-old actress is&nbsp;a&nbsp;Hollywood legend.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/9bc/f40/66ec3a5228a4798ef73782340a.jpeg><p>Linda Hunt is&nbsp;widely recognized and celebrated for her portrayal of&nbsp;the tenacious Hetty Lange on&nbsp;CBS’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i></a>. Her character has gained a&nbsp;cult following among fans of&nbsp;the show, and she has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>become</a> an&nbsp;LGBTQ+ icon due to&nbsp;her open and proud <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> to&nbsp;Karen Kline.</p><p>She has started her career in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>theater</a> but, she acknowledges that the theater wasn’t an&nbsp;obvious choice for stardom. Hunt said, “For me&nbsp;to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor was an&nbsp;improbable idea. I&nbsp;wasn’t beautiful or&nbsp;pretty in&nbsp;any conventional way.”</p><p>Although Hunt’s career has been defined by&nbsp;her role on&nbsp;<i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i> since 2009, her journey as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress had a&nbsp;humble beginning. You may recall seeing her in&nbsp;films such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Kindergarten Cop</i></a>, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Silverado</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Year of&nbsp;Living Dangerously</i></a>. Despite the initial challenges, Hunt’s talent and dedication have propelled her to&nbsp;great heights in&nbsp;the entertainment industry.</p><h2>But she <a href=#>managed</a> to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;Hollywood legend despite her disability and find her true love.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f22/235/4dc942524583f3a55091396064.jpg><p>While Linda Hunt’s professional career may have experienced a&nbsp;lull in&nbsp;the early 2000s, her personal life was flourishing. During this period, she embarked on&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-lasting <a href=# title=romance data-link=tag>romance</a> with Karen Kline, who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>therapist</a>. In&nbsp;2008, they took their love a&nbsp;step further and tied the knot, marking it&nbsp;as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most significant and joyful moments in&nbsp;Hunt’s life.</p><p>In&nbsp;the same year that California <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>legalized</a> same-sex marriage, Hunt and Kline celebrated their own marriage. They had been in&nbsp;a&nbsp;committed <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> for several years before taking this important step. Their love story began in&nbsp;1987, and throughout their time together, they have shared many precious moments.</p><p><h2>They don’t like sharing details of&nbsp;their relationship with the press and are not on&nbsp;social media.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/7ee/1e6/cf502e5e3da94f90850d16eb09.jpeg><p>Hunt and Kline have been inseparable for over 35&nbsp;years, and their love continues to&nbsp;flourish. While the exact details of&nbsp;how they met remain unknown, Hunt has shared some insights about their life. While Hunt and Kline have not become parents to&nbsp;children, their family <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>includes</a> three adorable dogs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/567/78c/d6dd9c52229f86af6420061fc9.jpg><p>We&nbsp;can all agree that their enduring relationship is&nbsp;indeed a&nbsp;rarity in&nbsp;today’s world. Their deep bonds and shared interests, such as&nbsp;their love for dogs, psychology, and affection, have been key factors in&nbsp;their long-lasting partnership. When Hunt is&nbsp;not occupied on&nbsp;the “NCIS: LA” set, she finds solace at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>home</a> with Kline. Their <a href=# title=home data-link=tag>home</a> serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;personal sanctuary where they can fully embrace their little paradise alongside their cherished pets.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/515/a7d/c7c5aa5bf3ba35117344683f52.png><p>As&nbsp;Hunt gracefully embraces her age, she understandably <a href=#>chooses</a> to&nbsp;work less and savor more precious moments at&nbsp;home with her beloved partner, Karen Kline. They are such a&nbsp;lovely couple who have created a&nbsp;beautiful home and a&nbsp;strong marriage! May they continue to&nbsp;build cherished memories together for years to&nbsp;come.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLmqusOaZKGtnql6rrHTZp%2Beql2lrrPAzZ6pZpqVm7yzsYyfmKadXZa7pXnEr5yrsaSdtq%2BzjLCcZqOepMRurcGorK1lpJ2yrnmXampubWdk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
