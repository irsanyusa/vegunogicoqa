Quickly surf a website to make sure there are options within your price range before you start shopping —so you don’t fall in love with a gown you can’t afford.</p><h3>Size range</h3><p>Similar to price range, you don’t want to go head over heels for a dress that doesn’t come in your size. Many of the retailers on this list sell dresses ranging from at least 0 to 16, but keep an eye on this as you shop.</p><h3>Style preferences</h3><p>If you know what style wedding dress you want, you may want to go straight to a designer specializing in this look. If you’re not sure, it’s smart to start with a retailer selling a variety of designers and styles so you can get a feel for what you might like before you start making decisions.</p><h3>Shipping and return policies</h3><p>It’s smart to check a retailer’s average shipping times before you begin shopping, especially if you’re working with a tight timeline. The average shipping time for the shops on this list is less than a week, but this may change if dresses are out of stock and you never want to cut it too close. Likewise, thoroughly read the return policy before you hit the purchase button. You don’t want to be caught with more dresses than you need.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-places-to-buy-wedding-dresses-online>How we selected the best places to buy wedding dresses online</h2><p>Buying a wedding dress is a big deal and we wouldn’t leave that purchase in just anybody’s hands. To compile our list, we looked for retailers considered reliable, trustworthy, and have an impressive variety of gorgeous dresses, as well as independent designers and boutique shops. We chose retailers offering something special and unique you wouldn’t find at a traditional bridal atelier, but with large selections and reasonable shipping and refund timelines.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the average budget for a wedding dress?</h3><p>If you’ve ever watched a show on TLC, you likely know wedding dresses can cost anywhere from a few hundred to tens of thousands of dollars. That said, most brides don’t dip into their retirement accounts for their wedding dress. According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>The Knot Real Weddings Study</a> of couples who got married in 2022, the average wedding dress cost was $1,900.</p><h3>What is the best month to buy a wedding dress?</h3><p>January is the best month to shop for a wedding dress. The holiday season is the most popular time of year for engagements, a stat of which designers have taken note and stocked their inventories accordingly. Plus, if you’re getting married in late summer or fall, it’s prime time to pick your dress and start checking things off your wedding planning list.</p><h3>Who usually buys the bride's wedding dress?</h3><p>This is going to vary by the family and the bride. Some families have traditions, such as the parents of the bride buying the dress, while in others it is on the bride to determine her budget and pay for her wedding day look. Before committing to a purchase, it’s smart to know who will be handing over their card before you start shopping.</p><h3>When should I buy my wedding dress?</h3><p>We recommend choosing your wedding dress at least eight months before your wedding. If you’re planning on purchasing several and then making your selection, the purchase should happen even earlier so you have “the one” by the eight-month mark. This gives you enough time to complete alterations, which typically require at least two rounds of fittings, shop for accessories and shoes, and plan your hair and makeup.</p><h3>How to ensure the fit is right</h3><p>Even if it seems like your dress fits well, it’s a good idea to take it to a seamstress for a fitting. They’ll make sure it’s snug in all the right places. Also, if you’re unsure of your size and the company has a flexible return policy, you can order the same dress in multiple sizes to make sure you get the one closest to a perfect fit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1loKGupLGMraZmmqWueqJ51p6bnaGenHqlvsSsqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
