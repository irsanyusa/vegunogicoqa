But as the new research details, women are expected to live significantly longer than men. As of 2021, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">latest year with federal data available</a>, life expectancy among U.S. men was 73.5 years, compared to 79.3 years among women.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Across the world, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">women tend to live longer than men</a> for a variety of reasons, some biological—such as hormonal differences—and some behavioral. Women tend to visit doctors more frequently and are less likely to smoke and drink excessively, for example. That’s been true in the U.S. for a long time. But the 2021 data represent the largest gender-based life expectancy gap in the U.S. since 1996.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The gulf began to widen before the COVID-19 pandemic, the authors note, but the trend accelerated from 2019 to 2021. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deaths from COVID-19</a> and unintentional injuries, a category that includes accidental <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">drug overdoses</a>, were the largest contributors to the widening of the gap, but differential rates of homicide, heart disease, and <a href=#>suicide deaths</a> also played a role, according to the report. It’s well-established that men die of these causes more frequently than women, and in recent years, they have been some of the most common causes of death overall. Heart disease, COVID-19, and unintentional injuries accounted for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three of the top five in 2021</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The gender gap would have been even wider, the authors note, but for factors including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">increases in maternal mortality</a> and decreases in cancer deaths among men.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Overall, the data underscore the continued importance of limiting COVID-19’s spread, and of finding better ways to improve national mental health and prevent drug overdoses and suicides—fatalities sometimes labeled by experts as “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">deaths of despair</a>.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZva2NphXh%2Fjq5krGWcnrOmecSxp56bpJa7pMWMoJynnJWneqitz2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
