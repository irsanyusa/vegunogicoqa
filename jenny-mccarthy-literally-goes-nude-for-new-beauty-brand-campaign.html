The risqué ad was inspired by the cosmetic company’s upcoming release of a nude collection of lip glosses.</p><p>The couple posed with props in front of a decorated fireplace and styled to look like a Christmas card. McCarthy covers her chest by holding two little dogs in front of her. Meanwhile, Wahlberg hides his privates with two huge bows while donning a Santa hat.</p><p>“It was fun to bare it all with my husband for this shoot,” McCarthy said. “I definitely have a thing for chestnuts roasting and large packages adorned with red ribbons.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">McCarthy</a> announced the debut of her cosmetics line in 2021 and named it Formless Beauty. Her current lip gloss line follows the release of three colors in 2021 and two others earlier this year. This interesting ad campaign to promote her new collection has definitely got the attention of many potential buyers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Each Buyer Has the Chance to Get a FaceTime Call from the Couple</h2><p>Adding another treat for the fans, McCarthy and Wahlberg also put in a lucky draw for the chance to FaceTime call the couple. For early-bird customers, the pair also signed 2,000 copies of their naked holiday advertisement.</p><p>“I love having fun with Jenny. She asked me right before “in-shape New Kids Donnie,” became a “doughnut-eating&nbsp;Blue Bloods&nbsp;Donnie,” so the timing was perfect.” Wahlberg said.</p><p>Particularly during this Christmas season, the business-minded couple has been extremely busy. The pair made time in their hectic schedules to attend the Electric Christmas Parade last week in St. Charles, Illinois. While McCarthy was managing the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season finale</a> of The Masked Singer and Wahlberg continues to be busy with his CBS drama, Blue Bloods.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_MeghanTrainor_Emma-McIntyreGetty-Images-for-dcp-220x147.jpg alt="Meghan Trainor Says She Wants to Get Pregnant, Write a Book in 2023" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yZ6lp7FdorCkrdGtn7JlnJ7Bpr7ApaOyZZeksrR5za6bnmWWpL9uusSwZJudkarBunnBq5innF2Yrq68wKKep2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
