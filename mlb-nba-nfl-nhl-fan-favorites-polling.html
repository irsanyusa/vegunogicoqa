You've got your hometown favorite and you also have your fantasy team favorite.”</p><p class=mb-s>Sports marketing experts identified a number of different factors that might make one league more successful than another in turning top players into household names, ranging from basic elements such as the number of athletes on the playing surface at a time to cultural nuances surrounding personal expression.</p><p class=mb-s>While MLB and the NBA generated virtually the same amount of favorite player responses, with 28 percent of Americans picking a favorite active player in each league, the number of different players varied widely between the two sports. Respondents named nearly twice as many active MLB players (137) as NBA players (77). Similarly, while only 15 percent of U.S. adults picked a favorite active NHL player, the number of different players selected (78) was about the same as the number of NBA players.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6K5o3nNm5hmppaheq%2B0y2admqZdm663u9Giq56rXaW8rbjIp54%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
