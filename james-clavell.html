The prison experience would later inform his work.</p><p>After the war, a motorcycle accident steered him away from military service toward the University of Birmingham and matrimony with April Stride, an actress who provided his entry point into the film industry.</p><p>Clavell initially worked in film distribution and then screenwriting, penning the screenplay for The Fly (1958). He also directed films, including Five Gates to Hell (1959). With the Writers Guild strike in 1960, he turned to novel-writing, producing King Rat (1962), which established his reputation as a novelist.</p><p>He continued his screenwriting career with credits including The Great Escape (1963) and ventured back into directing with To Sir, with Love (1967), which became a hit.</p><p>Meanwhile, Clavell began writing his Asian Saga. The series includes titles such as Tai-Pan (1966), Shōgun (1975), the latter of which was adapted into a popular TV miniseries in 1980. The character Peter Marlowe, featured in his books, is an alter ego for Clavell, reflecting his own wartime experiences.</p><p>Clavell became a U.S. citizen in 1963 and was known for his admiration of Ayn Rand's philosophy, which influenced his works.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>October 10</a>, <a href=#>1921</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</p><p class=info><b>Generation:</b> <a href=#><b>Greatest Generation</b></a><br><b>Chinese Zodiac:</b> <a href=#>Rooster</a><br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Libra</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>September 7</a>, <a href=#>1994</a> (aged 72)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Stroke</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Career Highlights</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1600-04-21</a> 1st date in James Clavell's novel Shogun (OS)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1841-11-26</a> 1st date in James Clavell's novel Tai-Pan</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1960-06-08</a> 1st date in James Clavell's novel "Nobel House"</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1967-06-14</a> British film "To Sir, with Love" written and directed by James Clavell, and starring <a href=#>Sidney Poitier</a> is 1st released in the US</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1979-02-09</a> Beginning of James Clavell's novel "Whirlwind"</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1990-11-29</a> Paul Chihara and John Driver's musical "Shogun - The Musical", based on James Clavell's novel, opens at Marquis Theater, NYC; runs for 72 performances</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1991-01-20</a> Paul Chihara and John Driver's musical "Shogun - The Musical", based on James Clavell's novel, closes at Marquis Theater, NYC, after 72 performances</li></ul><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwtsCmnKxlk6Gut7HLpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
