They might feel unsure about talking to&nbsp;women or&nbsp;convincing them of&nbsp;things because they’re not used to&nbsp;it, which can make them nervous.</p><p><h2>Foster says young people should concentrate less on&nbsp;stereotypes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85f/19b/fe31755b3c817ec96dcd8f1b61.jpg><p>AF Archive/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News</p><p>Foster recently <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> about how her 50s were a&nbsp;challenging time of&nbsp;change. With few role models to&nbsp;guide her, she had to&nbsp;figure out how to&nbsp;navigate being a&nbsp;woman of&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain age in&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p>She found support and inspiration in&nbsp;friendships with people of&nbsp;various ages. One of&nbsp;her dear friends is&nbsp;an&nbsp;80-year-old college professor who lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;commune during the 1970s. Through these friendships, Foster gained insight into what lies ahead and what’s possible.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa6/788/4000a456339ce36a49d14ba4f1.jpg><p>Charles Sykes/Invision/East News</p><p>When asked what advice she’d give to&nbsp;young people in&nbsp;her industry, Foster emphasized the importance of&nbsp;relaxation and finding one’s own path. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>believes</a> <strong>young people should focus less on&nbsp;the pressures</strong> and expectations and more on&nbsp;discovering what makes them unique.</p><p>She finds joy in&nbsp;helping them find their own voice and identity, rather than feeling burdened by&nbsp;the pressure to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the main character in&nbsp;their own story. “Because we&nbsp;weren’t free. Because we&nbsp;didn’t have freedom. And hopefully that’s what the vector of&nbsp;authenticity that’s happening offers&nbsp;— the possibility of&nbsp;real freedom,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>.</p><p><h2>Foster says that having makeup doesn’t mean you’re a&nbsp;woman.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/988/63e/de562c5b51a2c9ea098db069d0.jpg><p>LISA O'CONNOR/AFP/East News</p><p>There are <strong>different </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>ways</strong></a><strong> to&nbsp;express femininity</strong>, and it’s crucial for people to&nbsp;recognize that. Jodie talks about a&nbsp;non-binary <a href=# title=actress data-link=tag>actress</a> Bella Ramsey, who delivered an&nbsp;outstanding speech, and stood out in&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfectly tailored suit, with a&nbsp;simple hairstyle and no&nbsp;<a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a>.</p><p>As&nbsp;part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mentoring dynamic, Foster notices a&nbsp;recurring pattern. She explains that she often reaches out to&nbsp;young actresses, feeling compelled to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so&nbsp;due to&nbsp;her own challenging upbringing. Reflecting on&nbsp;Ramsey’s revelation to&nbsp;British Vogue about her orientation, Foster acknowledges a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;sympathy for her younger self. She recalls her own difficult experiences but also appreciated the support she received from her late mother, Brandy.</p><p>Brandy, a&nbsp;formidable presence in&nbsp;the entertainment industry, raised Foster and her siblings in&nbsp;Los Angeles, guiding Foster from her early years in&nbsp;commercials to&nbsp;her eventual stardom.</p><p><h2>Foster says being a&nbsp;man isn’t about mistreating others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9a2/884/bad60f58378b846ab653b1b4ee.jpg><p>AP/Associated Press/East News</p><p>Foster <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>has</a> two <strong>sons</strong>, Kit and Charles, who are in&nbsp;their twenties. She had them with her former partner, film producer Cydney Bernard. They separated in&nbsp;2008, and Foster has been married to&nbsp;photographer Alexandra Hedison for the past ten years. Foster finds it&nbsp;amusing to&nbsp;see how her sons were raised.</p><p>They weren’t into sports but preferred watching movies at&nbsp;home and spending time with their female friends. <strong>They’re really supportive of&nbsp;women’s rights</strong>. Foster shares an&nbsp;interesting story about her older son during high school.</p><p>He&nbsp;seemed unsure about what it&nbsp;meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;boy, having been raised by&nbsp;three women. He&nbsp;watched&nbsp;TV and thought being rude and disrespectful to&nbsp;women was the way to&nbsp;act like a&nbsp;man. Foster had to&nbsp;intervene, explaining that <strong>being a&nbsp;man isn’t about mistreating others</strong>. Despite this phase lasting for six months, Foster couldn’t let her son talk to&nbsp;her like that. She laughs as&nbsp;she shares the story.</p><p>Being a&nbsp;<a href=#>woman</a> can manifest in&nbsp;various ways, and it’s essential to&nbsp;recognize that diversity. Rather than conforming to&nbsp;stereotypes, it’s crucial to&nbsp;embrace individual interests and passions. Each woman is&nbsp;unique, with her own set of&nbsp;preferences, talents, and aspirations. By&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;what genuinely interests and fulfills&nbsp;us, we&nbsp;can break free from limiting stereotypes and carve out our own paths, contributing to&nbsp;a&nbsp;more inclusive and accepting <a href=# title=society data-link=tag>society</a> where everyone’s identity is&nbsp;celebrated.</p><p>Preview photo credit AF Archive/Mary Evans Picture Library/East News<span>, </span>Collin Xavier/Image Press Agency ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsdGeZJqqlWKxqrLFnqmepqRixKLF0mamn2WSmravs4yaZLCnnZa7brbOnaCeZZakwLWx0WaqmrGjYrqit8Sup2aho6PBbq2Mn5ymmZyaeqqwxKeroqypYoVyg5VucGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
