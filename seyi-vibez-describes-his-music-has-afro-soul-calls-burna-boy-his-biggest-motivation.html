I do conscious music a lot, anyone that knows Seyi Vibez knows me with a lot of conscious sounds, so when I started doing the South African Amapiano to my fusion, I started putting my conscious sound on it, even though there are fast beats, there are slow beats, I started adding my conscious sounds to it so that makes it more of my genre."</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Seyi Vibez further revealed that his sound is original as he isn't trying to be like anyone else.</p><p>"I’m not trying to sound like no one, it’s just pure me. The way I sing from way back, I also know how to put it on fast beats, so everything’s just going."</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-9cce6340-9e7f-4f5e-8bde-5b49698c7e5b data-caption="Seyi Vibez on Apple Music Africa Now Radio"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/sT5ktkpTURBXy9lNDIwYjIyODU4YjM4MzNiOGU3ZDYxYmViZjZlZjYwYi5wbmeRlQLNAxbNAxbCww></span><p><strong>On Burna Boy singing his song</strong>: Clips emerged on social media of <strong>Burna Boy</strong> gleefully singing along to Seyi Vibez's 'Chance'.
