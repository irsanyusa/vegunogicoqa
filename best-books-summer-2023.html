Told from Yeung’s point of view, this lyrically written high-seas adventure opens with the death of Yeung’s husband, commander of the feared Red Banner Fleet, during a botched raid on a Portuguese ship. From there, the novel traces Yeung’s struggles to secure control over the crew she believes she is destined to lead, navigate life as a new mother in a dangerous position, and defend her armies against the Chinese emperor’s push to eradicate piracy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now: </strong>Deep as the Sky, Red as the Sea on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Good Night, Irene</i></b><b>, Luis Alberto Urrea (May 30)</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/summer-books-preview-2023-goodnightirene.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mexican American author and Pulitzer Prize finalist <a href=#>Luis Alberto Urrea</a> has done it all: poetry, short stories, <a href=#>novels</a>, memoirs, and nonfiction.

As Xavier’s mother, Whitney, keeps vigil near his bedside, four narrators from different families in the neighborhood unravel the threads: Whitney herself; Rebecca, the emergency room doctor handling Xavier’s case; Blair, Whitney’s best friend and a stay-at-home mom; and Mara, an elderly Portuguese immigrant who has lived in the neighborhood since before it gentrified.

Don’t save your money or call real estate agents or pick out a white couch.

Then came a Pulitzer Prize. Next came <i>Everybody’s Fool</i>. And now, to round out the trilogy, Richard Russo brings readers back to the fictional community of North Bath in upstate New York with <i>Somebody’s Fool</i>. Donald “Sully” Sullivan, the protagonist of the first two books, has been dead for a decade, and now his son, Peter—and later, Peter’s estranged son, Thomas—are taking on central roles. The novel picks up as an unidentified body appears on the outskirts of town. Everyone in the community, including former police chief Doug Raymer and new chief (Doug’s ex) Charice Bond, is rocked by the discovery and desperate to learn who died and how. With wry wit, Russo spins a tale of small town life and the many ways humans form connections with one another.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Buy Now</strong>: Somebody’s Fool on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bookshop</a> | <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Amazon</a></p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><b><i>Family Lore</i></b><b>, Elizabeth Acevedo (Aug. 1)</b></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/summer-books-preview-2023-familylore.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Elizabeth Acevedo—a National Book Award winner and the 2023 Young People’s Poet Laureate—has written her first novel for adults.
