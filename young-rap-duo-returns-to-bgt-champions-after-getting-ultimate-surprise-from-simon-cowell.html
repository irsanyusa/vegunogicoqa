Their audition is currently the most viewed ‘BGT’ audition with 228 million views. Plus check out their ultimate comeback on ‘BGT: The Champions.’</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bars-melody-dominated-the-competition-on-bgt>Bars & Melody Dominated The Competition On ‘BGT’</h2><p>The duo decided to sing their version of a song called “Hope” by Twista and Faith Evans. Leondre wrote his rap verses of the song inspired by the bullying he experienced in school growing up. Charlie sang the other parts of the song.</p><p>The duo told judges they wanted to “give an awesome performance.” They did just that because immediately after they finished singing, audiences screamed for the judges to push the golden buzzer. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a> did the honors, causing the duo to cry tears of joy.</p><p>Cowell was really interested in Bars & Melody right away. During their audition, he even told them “I think that record could be a hit I really do.”</p><p>Bars & Melody, who said they had a strong connection the minute they met, continued strongly on ‘BGT.’ They made it all the way to the top three where they were eliminated, but their singing career did not end. The duo received a £500,000 record deal with Cowell’s record label, Syco Music. They also dropped a single called “Hopeful” in 2014.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>WHO IS YOUR FAVORITE TO WIN ‘AGT: THE CHAMPIONS’?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-they-made-their-big-return-to-the-stage>They Made Their Big Return to the Stage</h3><p>Five years later, they returned to ‘BGT: The Champions’ <a href=#>all grown up</a>, Leondre, then 18, and Charlie, 20, performed their song “Waiting for the Sun.” The boys were emotional afterward and embraced each other. They received high praise from the audience and the judges for their return. Alesha Dixon told them that they are one of her favorites ever from her time on the show.</p><p>Following this, they decided to also compete on America’s Got Talent: The Champions. Unfortunately, they didn’t get as much praise as they did back on ‘BGT: The Champions.’</p><p>After performing their original song “Lighthouse” Howie Mandel buzzed their performance.</p><p>“This is ‘Champions’ and that didn’t seem like a championship song. It didn’t seem like anything I haven’t seen before. That’s something I might watch on YouTube, but not really on a big stage,” he said.</p><p>Unfortunately, they ended up getting eliminated as they didn’t receive enough votes from the fans to advance to the semi-finals.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-are-they-now>Where Are They Now?</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Even though their time on the competition shows didn’t last, they continued to release music that they have generated throughout their years on the shows. They currently have 3 million youtube subscribers and an album called SADBOI that was just released this year. They have also released other albums over the years such as Generation Z, Never Give Up, and Teen Spirit.</p><p>The most recent project they worked on was a music video for their song “Own Ways.” It has 400,000 views on Youtube and was flooded with comments of people shocked at how much the boys have grown up since their first audition.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# class=broken_link>WHY ‘AMERICAS GOT TALENT: CHAMPIONS’ 2020 IS CANCELLED.</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Simon-Cowell-X-Factor-Kelly-Rowland.jpeg alt="Can Simon Cowell Sing? 5 Moments That Give Us a Clear Answer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK572Kisp59dp66xecOupmaqlanCs7rSZquoZZKcwW6vx5qkqaGfo8BurcWtnKtll5rBtbXNoGSupKSeuqLAxGaqrqqgp7a0sYyfqailXai2rrvNZpqor5WhuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
