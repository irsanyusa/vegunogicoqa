More than 30,000 cases of filming with the use of hidden cameras were reported to police in South Korea between 2013 and 2018, <a href=# rel=noopener>according</a> to media reports. Choi herself was a target. When a police officer rang her doorbell late one night, she found out that she was being filmed through her apartment window by a man on the rooftop of a nearby building.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Under the banner “My life is not your porn,” tens of thousands of women <a href=# rel=noopener>turned out</a> in 2018 in the capital Seoul to protest illegal filming. The protests prompted the government to enact <a href=#>some reforms</a>. But the rights group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a June 2021 <a href=# rel=noopener>report</a> that it remained difficult for women and girls targeted in digital sex crimes to get justice—a problem that Choi also faces. In 2019, prosecutors dropped 43.5% of sexual digital crimes cases, HRW says.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">TIME spoke with Seoul-based <a href=# rel=noopener>Youjin Do</a>, the director and producer of Open Shutters, to learn more about her film.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Youjin-Do_1.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why did you want to make a film about this issue?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">A couple of months after what happened, [Choi, who was formerly a colleague of Do] suddenly texted me and said, “We’ve got to make a documentary about what happened to me. Can you do that for me?” She said, “I want to take ownership of the story. I don’t want to stay as a victim.” She was really determined, really brave.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">What inspired me personally was that I spent my twenties outside of South Korea and I wasn’t there for the reboot of the feminism movement, which started around 2015 or 2016. Then, all my friends in South Korea, they started talking about feminism suddenly. I felt super indebted. My little sister lives in South Korea and I hadn’t done anything to make her life better at that moment.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>How #MeToo Is Taking on a Life of Its Own in Asia</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Did you change your behavior after you started learning about spycam issues? Did you do anything to protect yourself?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Every time I walked into a public toilet, I started looking around for tiny holes. It’s not hard to find them, I didn’t have to work hard. They’re literally everywhere.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And when I see the effort other women have made to cover a hole—there are tissues stuck inside some, some are covered by scotch tape, some have marker drawn on them—it breaks my heart. Why do we have to do this? This is f-cking crazy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-1133231113.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What progress has been made on the issue since your film was made?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I strongly believe the big protests [in 2018] made huge, huge changes. With that, so many brave women like [Choi] started speaking up and many media organizations started covering this.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I think there have been two major changes. The first one is how Korean society sees this issue. Back then, if some guy took a photo of a woman on the subway and posted it online and said, “Hey look at these legs,” no one thought that it was awful. But after all the protests and media started talking about it finally people started saying, “Huh, this is really awful.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>How History Puts Asian Women in America at Risk</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The language people have used to talk about it has changed too. “Molka” is a shortened version of the Korean expression of “Mollae camera” which means secretly filming someone. The term was widely used in news coverage of the protests [but] it often had a mischievous connotation, like a prank or hidden camera stunt. Now most of the Korean media and society use “Illegal filming” instead of “molka.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There were also some changes in our legal system. Lawmakers finally started introducing legislation to strengthen penalties and to protect and support victims. The government started establishing centers to help victims of illegal filming.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why do you think that these kinds of crimes are so prevalent in South Korea?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lack of awareness of gender equality. If you look at statistics related to gender equality in South Korea, you’ll see us at the bottom of the chart. Among developed countries we are at the bottom of the bottom. It’s a really weird situation. When it comes to GDP or our cultural influence—<a href=#>Squid Game</a> and <a href=#>BTS</a> and that kind of stuff—it looks like South Korea is a developed country. But when it comes to gender equality, it’s unspeakable. It’s just awful. I can’t understand why this is happening.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Do you still look around every time you go into a public bathroom?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes. We are not safe.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This interview has been edited for length and clarity.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">—With reporting by Aria Chen / Hong Kong.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvaWVphXSDjqinnqZdqLW2wNOeqaxlo6TCtbSMpKarnZFiwLHFwpqkZqWfobiiew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
