We at Bright Side would like to honor the memory of Robin Williams by remembering what a kind and compassionate human being he was.
1. He helped homeless people.
According to Brian Lord, a man who once wanted to book him for an event, Robin Williams had a requirement in his rider that said that every company that hired him, also had to give jobs to homeless people."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

His speech was in&nbsp;support of&nbsp;an&nbsp;act that would provide homeless people with <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> services and housing. He&nbsp;<a href=#>said</a>, “You can’t keep picking people&nbsp;up, you have to&nbsp;stop them from falling. That’s what I&nbsp;hope.”</p><p><h2>2. He&nbsp;was there for Christopher Reeve during hard times.</h2></p><p>Robin Williams and Christopher Reeve, who is&nbsp;best known for playing Superman, first met in&nbsp;college, and their friendship withstood the test of&nbsp;time. After Christopher Reeve had an&nbsp;accident that paralyzed him, Robin Williams supported his friend and cheered him&nbsp;up. It&nbsp;was actually Williams who made Reeve <a href=#>laugh</a> for the first time since the accident, when he&nbsp;came to&nbsp;visit him at&nbsp;the hospital. He&nbsp;was also involved in&nbsp;The Christopher &&nbsp;Dana Reeve Foundation, which is&nbsp;dedicated to&nbsp;curing spinal cord injuries.</p><p><h2>3. He&nbsp;raised awareness for sick kids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/751/ec6/dc90e3528687c9fd9101442669.jpg><p>Robin Williams was a&nbsp;<a href=#>supporter</a> of&nbsp;St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, whose mission is&nbsp;to&nbsp;find cures and prevent cancer and other life-threatening diseases in&nbsp;children. He&nbsp;spent his time with patients, entertaining them, and making them smile and laugh. “He&nbsp;made&nbsp;us feel like we&nbsp;were the superstars,” <a href=#>said</a> one of&nbsp;the kids’ moms. He&nbsp;also participated in&nbsp;various celebrity events that supported the cause of&nbsp;the hospital and starred in&nbsp;their <a href=#>commercials</a>.</p><p><h2>4. He&nbsp;stood up&nbsp;to&nbsp;corporate greed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6ad/ed8/d1f7975f66b6dda11513d46ad7.jpg><p>Robin Williams almost didn’t play Genie in&nbsp;<a href=#>Aladdin</a>, because he&nbsp;didn’t want his voice and his likeness to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;sell toys and merchandise to&nbsp;kids. He&nbsp;<a href=#>said</a>, “The one thing&nbsp;I said was&nbsp;I will do&nbsp;the voice. I’m doing it&nbsp;basically because&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;this animation tradition. I&nbsp;want something for my&nbsp;children. One deal&nbsp;is, I&nbsp;just don’t want to&nbsp;sell anything&nbsp;— as&nbsp;in&nbsp;Burger King, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;toys, as&nbsp;in&nbsp;stuff.”</p><p>He&nbsp;even <a href=#>passed on</a>&nbsp;the rights to&nbsp;his name, signature, photograph, and likeness to&nbsp;the Windfall Foundation, a&nbsp;charitable organization. He&nbsp;made sure that there wouldn`t be&nbsp;any advertisements with him for 25&nbsp;years after his death.</p><p><h2>5. He&nbsp;lifted people up&nbsp;with his kindness.</h2></p><p>“I&nbsp;was walking in&nbsp;New York at&nbsp;night and&nbsp;I see Robin Williams and a&nbsp;whole bunch of&nbsp;people getting his autograph. He&nbsp;signed gracefully, then took some photos with people. A&nbsp;guy in&nbsp;his 30s, a&nbsp;little overweight, comes and asks if&nbsp;Robin could please sign some memorabilia he&nbsp;had bought and saved for over 20&nbsp;years, because Robin was his hero.</p><p>Then he&nbsp;asks if&nbsp;he&nbsp;can take a&nbsp;picture, Robin says, ’Sure, boss,’ and the guy takes a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;just Robin and then Robin asks. ’Do you want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the photo?’ Then the guy looking down goes, ’Oh no, that’s fine...I...hehe...I’m ugly, I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;ruin the picture,’ and then Robin says, ’Don’t be&nbsp;like that, come here,’ and takes a&nbsp;picture with the guy.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>F*GGAW*GGA</a>&nbsp;/ reddit</p><p><h2>6. He&nbsp;could easily make friends with animals.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;2001, Robin Williams met with Koko, a&nbsp;gorilla that understands English and can communicate using American Sign Language. The 2&nbsp;bonded within minutes. They laughed, tickled, and hugged each other.</p><p>Robin Williams <a href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;recently had a&nbsp;mind-altering experience communicating with a&nbsp;gorilla. We&nbsp;shared something extraordinary: Laughter. Koko understands spoken English and uses over 1,000 signs to&nbsp;share her feelings and thoughts about daily events, life, love, even death. It&nbsp;was awesome and unforgettable.”</p><p>Their friendship was so&nbsp;genuine that after hearing about Robin Williams’ death, Koko became very sad.</p><p><h2>7. He&nbsp;stood up&nbsp;for his colleagues.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dba/9b5/76963c54f3b5a0b9e33bc3050e.jpg><p><a href=#>Lisa Jakub</a> was a&nbsp;teenager when she played the role of&nbsp;Robin Williams’s daughter in&nbsp;Mrs. Doubtfire. Because of&nbsp;the filming process, Lisa’s teachers at&nbsp;school would have to&nbsp;give her an&nbsp;increased workload, and they weren’t happy about&nbsp;it. That’s why she was kicked out. Lisa was upset about&nbsp;it, and Robin Williams noticed this.</p><p>When she told him what happened, he&nbsp;wrote a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;the school asking them to&nbsp;allow her to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;her classes and explaining that she was just trying to&nbsp;pursue a&nbsp;career, while also getting her education. He&nbsp;also said kind words about her character and her work. Unfortunately, the letter didn’t work, but the school framed it&nbsp;and hung it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the principal’s office.</p><p><h2>8. He&nbsp;comforted Steven Spielberg during the filming of&nbsp;<i>Schindler’s List</i>.</h2></p><p>Schindler’s List was a&nbsp;very emotional and difficult movie for Steven Spielberg to&nbsp;film. To&nbsp;cheer him&nbsp;up, Robin Williams would call Spielberg once a&nbsp;week and make him laugh. “Robin knew what&nbsp;I was going through, and once a&nbsp;week, Robin would call me&nbsp;on&nbsp;schedule and he&nbsp;would do&nbsp;15&nbsp;minutes of&nbsp;stand-up on&nbsp;the phone. I&nbsp;would laugh hysterically, because&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;release so&nbsp;much,” Spielberg <a href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>9. He&nbsp;could share a&nbsp;special moment with anyone, any time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b91/75c/1fb16952ff92caf4dce84b8715.jpg><p>“When I&nbsp;was around&nbsp;3, my&nbsp;father and&nbsp;I were in&nbsp;a&nbsp;waiting area at&nbsp;SFO. I&nbsp;started playing with another little boy and my&nbsp;dad realized Robin Williams was there and it&nbsp;was his son. My&nbsp;dad struck up&nbsp;a&nbsp;conversation about raising boys and the rollercoaster of&nbsp;feelings that is&nbsp;fatherhood. They shared a&nbsp;nice moment, human to&nbsp;human and father to&nbsp;father.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>greenbergz</a>&nbsp;/ reddit</p><p>“The year was 1998 when he&nbsp;filmed Patch Adams at&nbsp;UNC. His trailer was no&nbsp;more than 50&nbsp;ft from the exit door of&nbsp;my&nbsp;office. I&nbsp;was always late to&nbsp;the office and was lucky enough to&nbsp;have several conversations with Mr. Williams after work while he&nbsp;sat on&nbsp;the brick wall near my&nbsp;building, after campus life calmed down. What a&nbsp;funny and joyful person! I&nbsp;remember that he&nbsp;once asked me&nbsp;what size wrench a&nbsp;quantum mechanic needed to&nbsp;screw things&nbsp;up.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>Jim Murrell</a>&nbsp;/ Facebook</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2fd/b93/77d4c258beb42e0b609680b72e.jpg><p>“About 15&nbsp;years ago, I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;tiny needle removed from my&nbsp;tooth. The day after it&nbsp;was removed, a&nbsp;guy came, read a&nbsp;fairytale book, and signed&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;wasn’t until after Robin had passed that&nbsp;I learned from my&nbsp;parents who&nbsp;I met that day.”&nbsp;— <a href=#>HundredsOfSnow</a>&nbsp;/ reddit</p><p>“I&nbsp;met Robin Williams at&nbsp;Disneyland. He&nbsp;was behind me&nbsp;in&nbsp;line at&nbsp;the Tomorrowland Terrace, and&nbsp;I said “Hello, Mr&nbsp;Williams.” In&nbsp;a&nbsp;calm, low voice. And he&nbsp;said, “You’re doing it&nbsp;wrong,” and when&nbsp;I asked him, “What?” he&nbsp;launched into me&nbsp;with a&nbsp;hug and started yelling, “IT’S YOU! I&nbsp;CAN’T BELIEVE IT’S YOU!”&nbsp;— <a href=#>jlenney1</a>&nbsp;/ reddit</p><p>What role did Robin Williams play in&nbsp;your life? Have you ever met him?
