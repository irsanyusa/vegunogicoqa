He walked out toward me.
Both of us smiled.
The applause was just about frantic. We shook hands. The new president leaned forward and gave me a hug.

It was over in a second—less than that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was the kind of hug that says, “Hey, good to see you, man. Thanks for being here.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was the kind of hug I’d exchanged with thousands and thousands of Floridians over the years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I didn’t think a thing about it as it was happening.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But it changed the rest of my life.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Reach, pull, release—just like that.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As the president and I walked off the stage together, Terry Moran, co-anchor of ABC’s Nightline, was waiting backstage with a crew. He had been promised a joint interview with the Republican governor and the Democratic president about the stimulus plan and the power of bipartisanship.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“So, why?” Terry asked me. “Why are you here, governor?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That was an easy question. “Because it’s important to my state,” I said, “and this stimulus package would help us with education, infrastructure, healthcare and we’ve got a budget that’s getting tighter day by day.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Terry pressed harder. “So, Governor,” he said, “in Washington, not a single Republican House member voted for this bill. Only three Republican senators. What’s the disconnect between you as a Republican governor here in Florida and Washington Republicans?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I didn’t want to bash Washington Republicans. Why do that? “All I can explain is my perspective,” I said. “And it’s really as being the CEO of Florida and how it affects my state and how it affects our people and that it will benefit them enormously and that’s how I look at it. It’s no more complicated than that.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Terry turned to the president.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“How do you account for the difference?” he asked.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Well,” Obama said, “I think Governor Crist described it properly. He’s on the ground. He’s dealing with folks every day. I think in Washington, there’s a danger where the debates get very abstract. And frankly, that they’re very ingrown. It becomes more of a competition between Democrats and Republicans for power or attention or who’s controlling chambers than it is about what’s happening on the ground. And that’s a danger that both parties can fall into. It’s something that I want to fight. That’s why it’s so useful for me to come out and be on the ground here because it reminds me of what’s going on and why I was sent to Washington in the first place.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Nothing like the voice of the people,” I piped in.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Absolutely,” the president said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was just an uplifting moment, I thought. It gave hope to both of us. While the tone in Washington was stubbornly divided, it too could change—if the president and I just set the right example.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It was a beautiful sentiment, filled with the optimism that got me—a Republican governor—and him—a Democratic president—elected not so long before.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I didn’t know it yet. But that high-spirited day in Fort Myers—meeting Obama (bad enough) and greeting him with a hug (even worse)—ended my viable life as a Republican politician. I would never have a future in my old party again. My bipartisan hopes and dreams, I would discover soon enough to my shock and disappointment, were vastly overstated and hopelessly out of date.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Excerpt from <a href=# rel=noopener>The Party’s Over: How the Extreme Right Hijacked the GOP and I Became a Democrat</a>.
