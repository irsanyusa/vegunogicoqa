According to the comedian, her Law School Admission Test (LSAT) scores were “horrible,” so she entered whichever school would willingly take her. She later stayed in Trinity Law School in LA, finishing her four years there.</p><p>As she was working her way to a law school diploma, Jackie eloped with her then-boyfriend who she divorced from a year later. Since then, she’s worked multiple day jobs to survive. After a series of existential crisis, Jackie has finally discovered where her heart finds its purpose — comedy. This major career shift has probably become her best decision so far. Having endured her fair share of loves, tragedies, and embarrassing moments, Jackie channels such energy into her stand-up routines.</p><p>“She is so comedically versatile, she could work a bar mitzvah, a bachelorette party, or your uncle’s funeral,” her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website bio</a> reads.</p><p>Jackie’s “smart sense of fun” has made her a relatable icon in comedy. Through the years, she has become a multifaceted performer, attracting audience of all races, genders, and socio-economic classes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>She Made Simon Cowell Blush After Her Audition</h2><p>In 2019, she joined <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> and tickled America’s funny bone in her every performance. Her audition consisted of making jokes about her mother telling her she’s fat, sharing her opinion on weight loss competitions and finding friends on Facebook. Jackie got four yeses from the judges. But before <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a> gave her his nod, he walked on stage to hug her.</p><p>She continued to do comedy after the competition, hosting and getting featured in television shows. Jackie has performed stan-up routines in The Arsenio Hall show, Gotham Comedy Live, Last Comic Standing, and Kevin Harts LOL Network.</p><p>In addition to these, she’s become a paid regular and headlines in top comedy clubs including The Comedy Cellar and The Hollywood Improv. She’s also performed in The Laugh Factory, The Comedy and Magic Club, and the House of Comedy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jackie Released Her Stand-Up Special Menoplause</h2><p>As a body-positive Black woman, she intends to share her perspective about dating and sex, menopause and female friendships. This was made possible through Menoplause, her newest stand-up special. Today, it’s available in various video-streaming platforms.</p><p>Aside from this creative project, Jackie entertains her social media followers by posting jokes on Instagram and Twitter. Last November, she also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>announced</a> the fabulous news that she’ll be competing in AGT spin-off series, AGT All-Stars.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_KellyClarksonShow_Weiss-EubanksNBCUniversal-220x147.jpg alt="NBC Lawsuit Claims Musicians Weren’t Paid for ‘The Kelly Clarkson Show’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWRnMFurculZKyskafAbrjAsLCeql2pwrO6xJ1knKedmrGqrc1moZqbm56ybrLAm6ylp6WofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
