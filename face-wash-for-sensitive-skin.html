Removing makeup and dirt that may be clogging your pores is important to hopefully keep breakouts and skin irritation away. However, when you have sensitive skin, it can be tricky. Certain products might leave your skin feeling worse, making it itchy, red, or irritated, so it’s important to find products that are not only effective, but gentle. To compile my list of the best face washes for sensitive skin, I spoke to Dr. Simon Ourian, a cosmetic dermatologist at <a rel=nofollow href=#>Epione Beverly Hills</a>, to have a professional weigh-in on what products you should look for and avoid, as well as what’s best for other needs you may have.</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-when-buying-face-wash-for-sensitive-skin>What to consider when buying face wash for sensitive skin</h2><h3>Ingredients</h3><p>There are a lot of face washes out there, especially if you’re up on the latest beauty product launches, trends, or love a good <a rel=alternate href=#>beauty subscription box</a>. While those who have normal skin can try new products without thinking twice, people with sensitive skin need to be extra cautious about the ingredients. “Avoid potentially harmful components such as sulfates (like sodium lauryl sulfate), fragrances, <a rel=nofollow href=#>certain alcohols</a> (like ethanol and isopropyl alcohol), parabens, harsh exfoliating acids (such as glycolic and salicylic acid), and synthetic dyes, as they can cause dryness, irritation, and allergic reactions,” Dr. Ourian says.</p><h3>Hydration</h3><p>It’s important to keep your skin hydrated and moisturized, avoiding anything that will dry you out and lead to peeling or irritation. “When selecting a face wash, especially for sensitive skin, opt for ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ceramides, glycerin, niacinamide, aloe vera, and chamomile, which hydrate and soothe the skin,” Dr. Ourian says. Tip: Look for these ingredients when choosing night creams, as well.</p><h3>Fragrance</h3><p>Some natural fragrance extracts might be okay, but you’re always best just avoiding any fragrances when possible. “It's best to choose products labeled "fragrance-free" and "suitable for sensitive skin," and to conduct a patch test before fully incorporating a new product into your skincare routine. Also avoid products that scrub your face,” Dr. Ourian advises.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-best-face-wash-for-sensitive-skin>Our top picks for best face wash for sensitive skin</h2><h3>Best overall face wash for sensitive skin: <a rel=nofollow href=#>La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Wash</a></h3><p>The La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying face wash is gentle and cleanses the skin of dirt and grime when used with lukewarm water. It’s suitable for all skin types but Dr. Ourian says, “I recommend it for oily skin because it's formulated to preserve the skin's natural barrier, essential for managing oiliness without causing dryness.”</p><p>It includes some great ingredients for sensitive skin like ceramide-3 that can help moisturize, glycerin that can hydrate the skin, niacinamide (a soothing form of vitamin B3), and their special ingredient, La Roche-Posay prebiotic thermal spring water full of important minerals like selenium—a strong but natural antioxidant.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size: 13.52 fl. oz.</li><li>Key ingredients: Ceramide-3, glycerin, niacinamide, La Roche-Posay prebiotic thermal spring water</li><li>Price on publish: $16.99</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Soap-free</li><li>Oil-free</li><li>Fragrance-free</li><li>Sensitive skin tested</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviews claimed it wasn’t good for their skin type, making their skin dry, but I noticed the customer service team was on it, working with them to find a better product for their skin.</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you’re looking for a basic place to start, the La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Wash is a great option overall, but particularly for sensitive skin that’s oily.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best overall face wash for sensitive skin</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.laroche-posay.us/dw/image/v2/AANG_PRD/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-acd-laroche-posay-master-catalog/default/dw7aebca2e/img/tolerianepurifyingfoamingfacialwash/la-roche-posay-toleriane-cleanser-for-oily-skin-3337875545822-1.jpg alt="La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Wash" title="La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Wash" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>La Roche-Posay Toleriane Purifying Foaming Facial Wash</h3></p><h3>Best budget face wash for sensitive skin: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser for Sensitive Skin</a></h3><p>This foaming formula is gentle and inexpensive. “These budget-friendly options are great.

They use blue micro-algae to act as a bit of a barrier from any harmful dirt and grime, while the marine salicornia extract used acts as an intense moisturizer.
