In fact, its score dipped by 15 points and has only partially recovered.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Vegan20foods20affect20brand20buzz20updated.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p align=center><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>McDonald’s also saw a dip in its Buzz Score after it announced its new vegan offering in the form of vegetable-based dippers, which were initially poorly received online. However, since the release the brand’s Buzz Score has seen a recovery, rising over eleven points in two days. In comparison, Burger King has seen little growth in its positive Buzz Score despite the launch of its soya-based Rebel Whopper.</p><p>But have these new products got consumers talking? Looking at Word of Mouth scores (which tracks whether consumers have discussed the brand with friends and family in the last two weeks) almost all of the brands we are looking at have seen increases their scores following their new product launches.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Vegan20foods20affect20brand20cond20updated.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p align=center><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>Gregg’s and McDonalds’s both teased their new vegan products in the days running up to Christmas, which gave them a boost before the New Year, but the release of the new foods sees both brands ending neck and neck.</p><p>Costa and Burger King also saw jumps in their word of mouth scores in early January following the release of their products, but McDonalds ultimately takes the lead in terms of the most discussed brand.</p><p>However, does all this buzz and word of mouth exposure translate to more footfall for brands? Looking at consideration scores for each of our brands, McDonald’s, Gregg’s and KFC have all seen a large uptick in scores following the release of their new products. Gregg’s also saw a jump in its score thanks to its teaser advert release in the week before Christmas. However, this boost to consideration could be beginning to drop as time goes on.</p><a _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 class="link ng-star-inserted" href=#><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/Vegan20foods20affect20brand20WOM20updated.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p align=center><a href=#>Click to enlarge</a></p><p>Despite the release of new vegan sandwiches earning café chain Costa boosts in its word of mouth and Buzz Scores, the brand’s consideration score has dropped by almost ten points in the last few days while rival Café Nero sees it score jump to 15.6.</p><p>At the end of January we will check back in with these brands to see if the initial benefits wrought from new vegan menu options is carried through to the end of the month, or if the meat-free fad only offer short term boosts to brands.</p><p>Image: Getty</p><p><a href=#><strong>Learn more about YouGov BrandIndex here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksLC60q6knqpflr%2B1tcKlnKxnYmx%2FdIWMr5ygmZ6qrrPFjJ2mZpqilrulv4ybnKedlp7B</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
