Four days later, Tagovailoa suffered scary head and neck injuries against the Cincinnati Bengals on “Thursday Night Football” in front of more than 13 million TV viewers.
Tagovailoa’s situation forced the NFL and NFL Players Association to modify the league’s concussion protocol, including adding the term “ataxia” — described as “abnormality of balance and stability, motor coordination or dysfunctional speech caused by a neurological issue” — to the mandatory “no-go” symptoms."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Under the modified guidelines, Tagovailoa would have been diagnosed with a concussion against the Bills, and thus removed from competition.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A new Morning Consult survey showed that fans primarily blame the Dolphins for the debacle. One in 3 self-identified NFL fans and self-identified sports fans believe the NFL franchise’s coaching and training staff is most at fault for allowing Tagovailoa to re-enter the Bills game last month. Nearly 3 in 10 of both shares of respondents (28%) said the unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant, whom the NFL Players Association <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>terminated</a> amid the controversy, is most at fault.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Regardless of who’s to blame, the incident — and others like it — doesn’t appear to change most fans’ interest in America’s most popular sport. Nearly 3 in 4 fans (70%) said head injuries don’t affect their interest in watching NFL games.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Viewership remains strong&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Despite football’s inherent dangers to the brain, among other grievous bodily injuries, fans’ interest in the NFL remains strong, according to the recent Morning Consult data and TV viewership figures. NFL games currently <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>make up</a> 21 of the top 25 most-watched TV broadcasts of 2022, Sports Business Journal found, while Amazon.com Inc. has <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>continued to draw positive viewership numbers</a> in its inaugural season streaming “Thursday Night Football” on Prime Video. That includes the game in which Tagovailoa was concussed, forcing his arms into a “<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>fencing response</a>” —&nbsp;a telltale sign of a significant brain injury.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><i>The Oct. 8-9, 2022, survey was conducted among a representative sample of 2,210 U.S. adults, including 1,508 self-identified NFL fans, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively.
