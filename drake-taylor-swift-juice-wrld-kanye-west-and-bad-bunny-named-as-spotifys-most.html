Despite the controversy, his name gets mentioned in, The multiple grammy-winning rapper, producer, father, and former presidential candidate remains one figure in hip hop that can not be sidelined. Kanye West’s 10th studio album DONDA [which we witnessed one of the iconic rollouts for, and arguably the best we'll see in years] has received 33.4 million streams since its release. In addition, the build-up, production and dedication of the album to the rapper’s late mother, another major catalyst to the numeric success of DONDA was the brief feud Kanye had with fellow rapper Drake. The two released their albums in the same week. But, of course, beef fuels comparison. Comparison fuels competition. Competition fuels streams and numbers.</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-7476f8d7-3773-49eb-93c4-ad5e3ce6270c data-caption="Juice world"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/-1dktkqTURBXy8zZWMyYTJhYzFkMDgzNDc2YzZlNjQ2NDFlOTEyMDIzOC5qcGVnkZUCzQLlzQGewsM></span><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Two years after his tragic passing at 21, singer/ rapper juice WRLD's mournful and energetic songs on love, heartbreak and emotions remain cherished among the Gen-Z audience that witnessed the birth of trap music and emo rap.

I’m talking about the kind that will inspire biopics long after she's gone. At age 31, the singer is still breaking records, cracking charts as she evolves in sound and extension, telling her story the way she wants it said. After the release of her Alternative albums, Folklore & Evermore, In a bid to own her masters, The genre-bending singer began releasing re-recorded versions of her entire catalogue.
