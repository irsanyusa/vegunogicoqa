The win was Snook’s first Emmy for playing Shiv Roy on the hit HBO series, which ended its run last May after four seasons.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Thanks to everyone who voted and for loving the show as much as we did as a cast making it and as a crew making it,” Snook began after accepting the award from Jodie Foster, who presented the category. “We put our all into it and the bar was set so high. I think that’s what spurred us on from every department. We all gave it our best, led by [series creator] Jesse Armstrong and [director] Mark Mylod and my cast who I love so much and I’m going to miss.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Snook moved to thank those in personal life, including a new addition to her family: “To my mom and dad, I love you. Thank you for having a dress-up box when I was a kid. This is where it gets you! Also the biggest thank you though is to someone who won’t understand anything I’m saying at the moment, but I carried her with me in this last season. Really it was her who carried me. It’s very easy to act when you’re pregnant, because you’ve got hormones raging. It was the proximity of her life growing inside me that gave me the strength to do this and this performance. I love you so much. It’s all for you from here on out.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Snook also just won the Golden Globe this month for best actress in a TV drama and also won the Globe for supporting TV actress in 2022. She’s next up for the SAG Award for outstanding performance by a female actor in a drama series. Snook previously earned two nominations for supporting actress in a drama for “Succession.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This year, Snook won a category in which she faced off with Sharon Horgan (“Bad Sisters”), Melanie Lynskey (“Yellowjackets”), Elisabeth Moss (“The Handmaid’s Tale”), Bella Ramsey (“The Last of Us”) and Keri Russell (“The Diplomat”). Zendaya, who won the lead actress in a drama Emmy in 2022, was not eligible this time.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Anthony Anderson hosts and Jesse Collins Entertainment is producing the 75th <a href=# id=auto-tag_emmys data-tag=emmys>Emmys</a> telecast, with Jesse Collins, Dionne Harmon and Jeannae Rouzan-Clay as executive producers. The ceremony, taking place on Jan. 15 — Martin Luther King Jr. Day — was originally scheduled for Sept. 18 until the WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes led to the postponement.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This year’s nominations&nbsp;were announced&nbsp;on July 12, less than 48 hours before the SAG-AFTRA strike began, effectively halting all production and promotion in the entertainment industry.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">HBO’s “Succession” led this year’s Emmy nominations, with 27 — including best drama, lead actress (Sarah Snook) and a record three lead actor noms (Brian Cox, Kieran Culkin and Jeremy Strong). It took home prizes in outstanding drama series, outstanding lead actor in a drama for Kieran Culkin, outstanding supporting actor for a drama series for Matthew Macfadyen, outstanding writing for a drama series and outstanding director for a drama series</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The 75th Emmy recognizes shows that aired between June 1, 2022, to May 31, 2023. At the Creative Arts Emmys, which took place on Jan. 6 and 7, HBO’s “The Last of Us” dominated with eight wins while FX’s “Welcome to Wrexham” took home five awards. “Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie,” “The Bear,” “Wednesday” and “The White Lotus” all earned four each.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">See the<a href=#> full list of winners</a> from tonight’s Emmy Awards ceremony.</p><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4><ul class="o-nav__list lrv-a-unstyle-list lrv-u-flex lrv-a-space-children-horizontal lrv-a-space-children--050 lrv-u-align-items-center lrv-u-flex-wrap-wrap lrv-u-justify-content-center" aria-labelledby><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Emmys,</a></li><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Sarah Snook,</a></li><li class=o-nav__list-item><a class="c-link lrv-a-unstyle-link a-content-ignore lrv-u-color-black u-font-family-secondary lrv-u-whitespace-nowrap u-color-action-blue:hover u-font-size-18@desktop-xl u-font-size-18@tablet u-letter-spacing-0002" href=#>Succession</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiukae2psDYZ5qopV9nfXOAjq2taJmnlr%2Blv46smKuZmGLAr7vOpGSepZ2ueqOx0q1kmpukp7K0v4ydqZqlkWJ%2Bc3%2BUcW5pbWdpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
