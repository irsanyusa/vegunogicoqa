Stealing each other's wives - Niger</h2></p><p>In the Wodaabe tribe of Niger in West Africa, men are known to steal each other's wives.

However, at the yearly Gerewol Festival, Wodaabe men wear elaborate makeup and costumes and dance to impress the women – and hopefully steal a new wife.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>If a man is able to steal away undetected (especially from a current husband who may not want to part with his wife), then they become socially recognized.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>2. Spitting as a form of greeting - Maasai tribe</h2></p><p>The Maasai tribe, found in Kenya and Tanzania, spit as a way of saying hello.

Furthermore, the Maasai tribe is also famous for its drinking of fresh animal blood.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-9>3. Festival of the dead - Malawi</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>The Chewa community is a Bantu tribe mostly found in Malawi.</p><p>During the burial ceremony of a tribe member, it is customary for the body of the deceased to be washed.</p><p>The corpse is taken to a sacred place where the cleansing is done by slitting the throat and pouring water through the insides of the dead.</p><p>The water is squeezed out of the body until it comes out clean.

Beating to earn a wife - Fulani</h2></p><p>The Fulani tribes practise Sharo before getting married. Here the groom is beaten by the older members of the community so as to earn a wife and respect.
