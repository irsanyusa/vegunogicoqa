On yesterday’s episode of The Kelly Clarkson Show, Clarkson was joined by Dancing With the Stars pro Cheryl Burke and cooking legend, Gordon Ramsay. The host and her guests took to the kitchen as if they were on one of Ramsay’s shows.</strong></p><p>The celebrities were set out to make shrimp scampi in under five minutes. Their cooking spaces had every ingredient pre-portioned in front of them, all Clarkson and Burke had to do was listen to Ramsay’s direction. Somehow, the energy on stage became similar dynamic to Ramsay’s cooking series, <a href=#>Hell’s Kitchen</a>. The kitchen became so chaotic with Ramsay’s energy. Clarkson became extremely overwhelmed by the energy on her show.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-kelly-clarkson-doesn-t-enjoy-glimpse-into-the-life-as-one-of-gordon-ramsay-s-chefs>Kelly Clarkson Doesn’t Enjoy Glimpse into The Life as One of Gordon Ramsay’s Chefs</h2><p>After the show aired, Clarkson posted an <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram reel</a> to let fans know how she really felt about the segment.</p><p>“Cooking with Gordon Ramsay is like… Oh my god,” Clarkson said. “I feel an ache for all of the people that have done that before in their life.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Clarkson became noticeably overwhelmed as this segment went on. Ramsay was trying to help the ladies figure their way around the recipe, but Clarkson received a lot of F bombs in response from Ramsay. Near the end of the recipe, Clarkson began drinking her wine at her station and joking about how she’ll need more after the show.</p><p>Compared to Clarkson, Burke was totally calm. Burke was definitely Ramsay’s favorite chef on this show. The professional dancer joked with the chef on the show saying that next time they’d slow it down a bit for the recipe. Clarkson on the other hand, hadn’t gotten over the fast pace of the recipe and had proceeded to eat her dish. She made sure to let Ramsay know that his yelling scared her.</p><p>This segment of The Kelly Clarkson Show was extremely entertaining. I hope we’ll see another Ramsay collaboration in the future of this talk show. As always, his coaching style was extremely entertaining.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Kyle.jpg alt="David Walliams Told Him to Get a Singing Coach, Then Kyle Tomlinson Got a Golden Buzzer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xqipnaeeYr%2BiudKasGafmauytHnKnqOlsV2YuaK%2Byqymp2WRYsGiv9OeZKieXZ2yrbjSZqKirJOdsq97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
