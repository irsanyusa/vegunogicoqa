His hilarious rendition of “She Bangs” by Ricky Martin took the world by storm over a decade ago. His awful singing, but infectious personality left the original Idol judges cracking up. Today, Hung is a financial coach, published author, and public speaker.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-from-american-idol-to-financial-coach>From American Idol to Financial Coach</h2><p>“I help poker players with money anxiety use activity-based budgeting to build a secure future,” Hung states in his Instagram bio.</p><p>It seems kind of odd to picture William Hung as a financial coach. He actually performed on stage with Ricky Martin just three years ago, but he actually seems quite successful at his new career. His latest post explains that he is in the process of developing a program to help poker players build a more secure future.</p><p>The former civil engineering student has found a way to help professional card players make long-term investments. Using stocks and real estate, his mission is to save his clients lots of money. Hung uses his financial business to not only help people with money, but to motivate their lives as well.</p><p>“Imagine if you have the power to live the life on your own terms,” Hung shared in an <a href=# class=broken_link>Instagram post.</a> “You have the freedom to spend more time with your family and friends. You can wake up doing what you love for the rest of your life and not stress out about money.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CQwPcMGhB28/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-william-shares-his-advice-with-the-world>William Shares His Advice With the World</h2><p>William has spoken at a number of events including TED talks and charity galas. He was a guest on&nbsp;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Ellen DeGeneres Show. The Hong Kong native has also launched The William Hung Show, and interviews a variety of guests. The theme of the show revolves around chasing your dreams in authentic ways.</p><p>William’s book, <a href=# class=broken_link>“Champion By Choice,</a>” can be purchased on Amazon and at Target. Here, he offers the three C’s to live by: communication, context, and connection. In this book, you will be encouraged to tap into your true potential, turn negativity into something amazing, and reach for the stars.</p><p>All in all, William is killing it with his new business. When Simon Cowell shut him down, he chose to create success. I wouldn’t be surprised to see his fame grow even bigger, and gain more social media attention. What could be next for the icon? The possibilities are endless.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Carrie-Ann-Inaba-DWTS-Will-Carrie-Ann-be-on-DWTS-Dancing-with-the-Stars-Season-30-scaled-1.jpeg alt="Carrie Ann Inaba to Judge ‘Dancing With the Stars’ Season 30 Amid Health Battles" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qKjpaGRonqpwc2gZK2glWK6sL%2FTZqWorJ%2BntrDB0maYpp2inrCiuoyim6ikXZi8r8DErKuapqRiu7DDjJpkn6GelruktcClZJynkZi1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
