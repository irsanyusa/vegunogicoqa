Grace explained that her parents have always been a&nbsp;team, and this journey was no&nbsp;different.</p><p>The couple began exercising and eating a&nbsp;healthy diet, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>after six months</a>, they took new profile pictures. However, even after achieving their initial goal, they decided to&nbsp;keep going and push themselves further.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/317/3a6/a9bcb854a48a12e91623a6ea1c.png><p>Apart from their workout routines, the senior couple also shares updates <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>about their everyday life</a>. They post about going on&nbsp;dates, shopping for fashionable athletic wear, and even share their diet plans. The duo truly does it&nbsp;all and does it&nbsp;with enthusiasm!</p><p><h2>The gym is&nbsp;their typical date spot.</h2></p><p>Many of&nbsp;us wouldn’t even think of&nbsp;the gym as&nbsp;a&nbsp;date spot. However, they regularly go&nbsp;and have gym dates either in&nbsp;the evening or&nbsp;during the day.</p><p>The couple’s life is&nbsp;nothing we&nbsp;would expect from a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;their age. They are just purely awesome, and they also share their joyful life in&nbsp;many perspectives.</p><p><h2>Their children hold an&nbsp;equal place of&nbsp;importance in&nbsp;their hearts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b01/81e/3d7f3c571989d887d141a3a5e3.jpg><p>The couple lives far away from their children. Their daughter and eldest son reside in&nbsp;America. However, distance doesn’t stop them from getting together.</p><p>Every summer or&nbsp;winter, the whole <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> goes on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip. Even though it’s a&nbsp;short journey, the time they spend together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family is&nbsp;more precious to&nbsp;them than anything else.</p><p>The Beatles sang a&nbsp;song called “All you need is&nbsp;love.” But in&nbsp;real life, arguments, spending time alone, and disagreements are what really make relationships stronger and more interesting. When you have your first fight, you might feel upset and start questioning your partner. However, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>psychologists say</a> that going through these challenges <a href=#>helps couples</a> understand each other better and ultimately become stronger.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqmsdNmmGajn6eyorqMnKauqJyaend9jG5tZq%2BYpHq0wMCrq56cXay8s7fIp55mp6WperW7xp6roZ2iYq6vsIypqaiulZl6tbTArWSaZZiarq3Ax7JknKelpbmmedKtmLKrXam8qLHToZyrZWhmgXGAk2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
