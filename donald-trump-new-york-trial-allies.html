Attendees at Trump’s hush-money trial have so far included the Republican House Speaker, several members of Congress, state attorneys general, and two of Trump’s former presidential primary opponents. Notably absent is Melania Trump, the former First Lady, who is yet to appear in the courthouse.
The politicians rallying behind Trump used their presence at the courtroom to attack witness testimony, since the former President is barred from publicly commenting on key figures in the trial."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Notably absent is Melania Trump, the former First Lady, who is yet to appear in the courthouse.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The politicians rallying behind Trump used their presence at the courtroom to attack witness testimony, since the former President is barred from publicly commenting on key figures in the trial. Trump is currently facing trial on 34 felony counts over allegations that he falsified business records to conceal a hush-money payment to an adult film actress before the 2016 election. <a href=#>Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen</a> testified on Monday that Trump personally approved the hush-money reimbursement plan central to the criminal allegations.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The display of support from Trump’s allies is expected to continue throughout the trial, with more political figures vowing to join him in court soon. For many, the courthouse provides a stage to amplify their loyalty to Trump and gain exposure amid the media frenzy surrounding the historic trial.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“We have a lot of them that want to come,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “I say just stay back and pass lots of laws to stop things like this.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s a look at who has come to Trump’s side at the trial.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>House Speaker Mike Johnson</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">House Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday became the highest ranking Republican to accompany Trump at his criminal trial, blasting the proceedings as a sham. “These are politically motivated trials and they are a disgrace. It is election interference,” the Louisiana Republican told reporters in the park outside the Manhattan courthouse.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He claimed Democrats are keeping Trump off the 2024 campaign trail, and criticized Cohen, the prosecution’s key witness. “This is a man who is clearly on a mission for personal revenge, and who is widely known as a witness who has trouble with the truth,” Johnson said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His visit to the courthouse comes just a week after Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican from Georgia, unsuccessfully attempted to oust him as Speaker, in part because he refused to agree to defund <a href=#>special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation</a> into Trump.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Reps. Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz</strong>, and other House Republicans</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nine Republican lawmakers went to the Manhattan courthouse Thursday to stand by Trump: Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, Florida Rep. Mike Waltz, Arizona Rep. Eli Crane, Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles, <a href=#>Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna</a>, South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, and Virginia Rep. Bob Good.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Many of the lawmakers shared their support for Trump on X. “They may have gagged President Trump. They didn’t gag me. They didn’t gag the rest of us,” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Boebert</a><a href=#> wrote</a>. “This is a pathetic political witch hunt!”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Three other House Republicans have stopped by the Manhattan courthouse earlier in the trial: Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, New York Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, and Florida Rep. Cory Mills. Donalds is considered a possible vice presidential contender.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Vivek Ramaswamy</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy</a> also attended the trial on Tuesday, as he may be angling for a spot in Trump’s cabinet. He has long been considered a contender to be Trump’s Vice President in a potential second term. Ramaswamy called the trial “an insult to American democracy” on social media.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Eric and Lara Trump</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Trump's son Eric is the only Trump family member to attend the trial regularly. His wife, Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, was also in attendance on Tuesday, roughly two months after she was elected co-chair after being endorsed by her father-in-law.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Florida Sen. Rick Scott</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who is running for reelection in November, on May 9<strong> </strong>became the first high-profile Trump ally to accompany him in the Manhattan courtroom. He drove with Trump from Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue down to the courthouse and sat in the front row while the defense questioned adult film star Stormy Daniels, one of the key witnesses in the case.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I’m here because I have known Donald Trump a long time,” Scott said. “I knew him before I was governor. I consider him a friend. And what he is going through is just despicable.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Ohio <strong>Sen. J.D. Vance</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, widely seen as a vice presidential contender, was part of the group that arrived at court with Trump on Monday and stood behind him as he addressed reporters before entering the courtroom.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Every single person involved in this prosecution is practically a Democratic political operative,” Vance told reporters outside the courthouse, adding that it was a “disgrace” Trump could not say so himself because of a gag order. Vance, once a harsh critic of the former President, previously said he “can’t stomach Trump” but is now a close ally and will appear with him at an Ohio fundraiser on Wednesday.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Alabama <strong>Sen. Tommy Tuberville</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Sen. Tommy Tuberville attended the trial on Monday, telling reporters that the Manhattan courtroom was “the most depressing thing I’ve ever been in.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“First of all, I’m disappointed in the courtroom. I’m hearing, ‘Mr. Trump, Mr. Trump.’ He is ‘former President Trump,’” the Alabama Republican said outside. “Give him some respect. I mean, that’s what that place is in there. It is no respect. Here is what I’m seeing, too. It is depressing. That courtroom is depressing. This is New York City. The icon of our country. And we got a courtroom that is the most depressing thing I’ve ever been in.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Tuberville also criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, saying that he enters the courtroom and “acts like it is his Super Bowl.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, who is also reportedly on Trump’s shortlist for vice presidential picks, appeared in the Manhattan courtroom on Tuesday alongside the former President. He endorsed Trump in January after dropping his own Republican presidential bid, calling Trump a “friend” and “partner.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">He has previously criticized Trump: in July, Burgum <a href=#>said</a> that he would not do business with him, stating “you’re judged by the company you keep.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Attorneys General of Alabama and Iowa&nbsp;</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird and Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall both attended Trump’s trial on Monday, sitting near the front of the courtroom. When Trump won the Iowa caucuses, he told the crowd in his victory speech that Bird is “going to be your governor someday."</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>Absent: Melania Trump</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">About a month into the trial, Melania Trump is yet to appear in the courtroom or on the campaign trail with her husband.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As Cohen took the stand on Monday, he testified that Trump told him it was Melania who came up with the infamous <a href=#>“locker room talk”</a> defense when an <a href=#>Access Hollywood tape</a> was revealed in October 2016 in which Trump was heard boasting that "when you’re a star" you can "do anything" to women, including "grab them by the p----."</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Cohen also stated in his testimony that Trump didn’t care about how his wife would react to his alleged affair with Stormy Daniels, and was mostly thinking about his campaign. (Trump denies having a sexual encounter with Daniels.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">-With additional reporting by Chantelle Lee/New York</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWdshnZ9jp2mp5mcmXq1vtSmp2amlax6urvRpGStqpmWuW6ty6Wgnqtf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
