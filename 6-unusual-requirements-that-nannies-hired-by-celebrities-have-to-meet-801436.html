Traveling with your favorite singer or&nbsp;actress and their family sounds like something interesting, and you’ll likely have fun anecdotes to&nbsp;tell your friends. However, not everything about this job is&nbsp;roses and sunshine. People who want to&nbsp;apply for this job must go&nbsp;through a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;very complicated tests and meet several requirements, and some of&nbsp;them are very peculiar.</p><p><strong>Bright Side </strong>wants to&nbsp;share some of&nbsp;the tests and requirements that celebrity nannies must meet, just in&nbsp;case you were thinking about going to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>.</p><p><h2>1. They must have prior experience.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cb6/0b7/5b571e50bbad53769eb32001ea.jpg><p>One of&nbsp;the first things that nanny recruiters in&nbsp;Hollywood look for is&nbsp;for candidates to&nbsp;be&nbsp;over the age of&nbsp;35. This is&nbsp;because celebrities don’t want to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;girl that’s coming into their homes looking for fame instead of&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;their kids, for example. All they want is&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=#>experienced</a> person who knows how to&nbsp;handle children, hassle-free and without any issues regarding their application.</p><p><h2>2. They must always be&nbsp;available.</h2></p><p>A&nbsp;nanny in&nbsp;Hollywood must be&nbsp;prepared to&nbsp;change and adapt her schedule time and again to&nbsp;whatever plan is&nbsp;on&nbsp;the parents’ minds, no&nbsp;matter how sporadic it&nbsp;may&nbsp;be. For example, the <a href=#>requirements</a> that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie had for the woman who worked for them were numerous. For them, it&nbsp;was essential that she had a&nbsp;bachelor’s degree and that she spoke at&nbsp;least 2&nbsp;languages (including the mother tongue of&nbsp;the stars’ adopted children). Finally, one of&nbsp;the most important ones was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;available to&nbsp;travel throughout the United States and Europe.</p><p><h2>3. They must be&nbsp;ready for ultra-specific demands.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7dc/e1f/483c74507db020defa4322e68f.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you’re one of&nbsp;the few women who manage to&nbsp;land one of&nbsp;these jobs, be&nbsp;prepared to&nbsp;receive all sorts of&nbsp;special demands, some of&nbsp;which you’ll soon find out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;ultra-specific. Sarah Jessica Parker, for example, <a href=#>asks</a> her nanny to&nbsp;continually replenish a&nbsp;specific shower gel and facial cleanser in&nbsp;her children’s personal showers. Instead of&nbsp;buying one big batch of&nbsp;many of&nbsp;these products, she must check each one daily and replace only the ones that have completely run out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/787/3e2/265a1a5e76a53959e0e272afb8.jpg><p><h2>4. They must be&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;run when the paparazzi arrive.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/870/127/8792865d3098867441aac7a054.jpg><p>When landing somewhere, or&nbsp;even in&nbsp;the most unexpected moment, <a href=# title=paparazzi data-link=tag>paparazzi</a> can be&nbsp;seen running toward celebrities to&nbsp;ask a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;questions. Depending on&nbsp;the celebrity you’re working for, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nanny, you might be&nbsp;asked to&nbsp;step back and let them talk or&nbsp;even to&nbsp;go&nbsp;away for a&nbsp;while. This is&nbsp;because many celebrities want to&nbsp;give the <a href=#>impression</a> that they can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;all: keep a&nbsp;busy schedule, shoot movies, do&nbsp;charity work, and raise their children on&nbsp;their own. What the media says about them puts a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;pressure on&nbsp;them, and they don’t want to&nbsp;take on&nbsp;more than they have&nbsp;to.</p><p><h2>5. They’re not allowed to&nbsp;use phones.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/780/0f2/8222c457d3a1e6f4e42c4c1ba1.jpg><p>Something that is&nbsp;definitely forbidden in&nbsp;this job is&nbsp;to&nbsp;get distracted. This is&nbsp;something that Kim Kardashian and Kanye West’s 6&nbsp;nannies can definitely attest&nbsp;to. For instance, they’re not allowed to&nbsp;use their phones during the day while they’re at&nbsp;work. If&nbsp;they get caught <a href=#>using</a> one, they may get fired.</p><p><h2>6. They must be&nbsp;ready for a&nbsp;thorough background check.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/10e/dca/3e51e5534ea5d2f541b927f4b2.jpg><p>If&nbsp;you’re applying for a&nbsp;nanny job in&nbsp;Hollywood, be&nbsp;ready to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through a&nbsp;rigorous screening process. It’s almost as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you were hired to&nbsp;be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the secret service! The whole process can take a&nbsp;long time, during which celebrities hire a&nbsp;vetting team worthy of&nbsp;a&nbsp;secret agent movie. For example, this is&nbsp;what happens with the Not Just Baby Sitters agency, which <a href=#>makes sure</a> a&nbsp;nanny’s reliability is&nbsp;always beyond perfection.</p><p>Being a&nbsp;nanny to&nbsp;a&nbsp;celebrity’s children is&nbsp;far from a&nbsp;sumptuous experience, however, it’s can prove to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;full-fledged adventure. If&nbsp;you could choose, what celebrity would you work for? How do&nbsp;you imagine it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;to&nbsp;live with him or&nbsp;her?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZINuwc2uqq6ZnGK%2Fpr3UoqmepZWjwbR506GYrWWelruvtcSsZKGhopqxbq7YZpqepJWXv6rAyJ6qZqCRq7JuwM5mpJ6dpGKFcX2TbG1o</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
