And if&nbsp;you think about&nbsp;it, many of&nbsp;those events we&nbsp;learned in&nbsp;school inspired hundreds of&nbsp;movies and documentaries we&nbsp;love. So&nbsp;this disinterest may be&nbsp;because many historical figures are often portrayed as&nbsp;serious fellas with long beards and serious expressions that only bring on&nbsp;boredom. But perhaps we&nbsp;aren’t looking at&nbsp;the right photographs since, in&nbsp;their youth, many of&nbsp;the most famous intellectuals were great models... of&nbsp;beauty.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> wants to&nbsp;teach you a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;“male beauty history,” so&nbsp;we’ve selected images of&nbsp;15&nbsp;classic models that made&nbsp;us think we&nbsp;were born in&nbsp;the wrong time and place.</p><p><h2>1. Johannes Brahms</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b84/173/9f138d57eb977446bc319a155a.jpg><p>Although many would find Brahms’ features incredibly attractive, he&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;model or&nbsp;actor, but a&nbsp;German <a href=#>pianist</a> in&nbsp;the 1800s. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;<a href=#>perfectionist</a> in&nbsp;his work and <a href=#>a&nbsp;lover of&nbsp;nature</a>, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;took long solo walks through the forest. His personality could be&nbsp;somewhat rough but he&nbsp;was kind to&nbsp;children and gave them <a href=#>treats</a> to&nbsp;please them.</p><p>He&nbsp;never married, but he&nbsp;did fall deeply in&nbsp;love with the pianist, <a href=#>Clara Schumann</a>. She, however, was married to&nbsp;another man, which made Johanne suffer and <a href=#>write</a>: “I&nbsp;can’t do&nbsp;anything other than think about you... What have you done to&nbsp;me? Can’t you undo the spell you have cast on&nbsp;me?”</p><p><h2>2. Charles Chaplin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e6d/9e8/206b735a53aa8ee5cc7f542277.jpg><p>Frequently, people remember <a href=#>Chaplin</a> for his signature hat, makeup, and funny mustache. However, what they don’t know is&nbsp;that underneath that disguise hid a&nbsp;handsome man that was bursting with charisma. Can you imagine seeing him on&nbsp;the big screen without his signature appearance? He&nbsp;probably wouldn’t have become as&nbsp;iconic, but for many, it&nbsp;would’ve been a&nbsp;feast for the eyes.</p><p><h2>3. Rupert Brooke</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b3b/be1/83d9bd583a8299bed76cdcb1e1.jpg><p><a href=#>Rupert Brooke</a> was a&nbsp;poet who, in&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;perfectly posing as&nbsp;the Greek god <a href=#>Comus</a>, wrote exquisite sonnets. His beauty was widely acknowledged in&nbsp;his day. Poet William Butler Yeats <a href=#>described</a> him as&nbsp;the “handsomest man in&nbsp;England,” and even <a href=#>John Gillespie Magee, Jr.</a> went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;write a&nbsp;<a href=#>piece</a> about him called Sonnet to&nbsp;Rupert Brooke.</p><p>He&nbsp;had a&nbsp;long history of&nbsp;romantic affairs with people from different countries and professions, but just as&nbsp;the god Comus was personified as&nbsp;a&nbsp;young being, Rupert left this world at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age from something as&nbsp;random as&nbsp;the bite of&nbsp;an&nbsp;infected mosquito when he&nbsp;was 27&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>4. Thomas Edison</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c5c/b06/6caf3e59359f6724463d90afe5.jpg><p>He&nbsp;was the <a href=#>inventor</a> credited for designing the electric light bulb and the motion picture camera. He&nbsp;also played a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;the film industry: his New Jersey laboratory owned one of&nbsp;the world’s first film studios, dubbed the “Black Maria.” In&nbsp;his youth, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;can see, he&nbsp;surely enlightened more than one heart with his bright eyes and gorgeous face.</p><p><h2>5. Jack Kerouac</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/791/138/3d8ab75923a966a1ef8fc8c947.png><p><a href=#>Jack</a> <a href=#>Kerouac</a> was a&nbsp;novelist born in&nbsp;1922, who could show off his beauty as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;his brains. Sadly, indulging in&nbsp;a&nbsp;careless lifestyle full of&nbsp;excess, he&nbsp;died of&nbsp;an&nbsp;internal hemorrhage caused by&nbsp;cirrhosis. Fortunately, he&nbsp;left behind many works that we&nbsp;can enjoy today. Who knows, perhaps some of&nbsp;the editions include his portraits.</p><p><h2>6. Mike Tiernan</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/802/1e6/1467165207a2e226c8005f5087.jpg><p>No, he&nbsp;is&nbsp;not posing as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model lying on&nbsp;the floor, he’s practicing sport. <a href=#>Mike Tiernan</a> was a&nbsp;famous baseball player, and boy, could he&nbsp;have made&nbsp;us gain interest in&nbsp;the game just by&nbsp;watching him! He&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the great hitters of&nbsp;the nineteenth century, and even in&nbsp;the twenty-first century, his photos can spark a&nbsp;home run in&nbsp;our hearts.</p><p><h2>7. Hermann Rorschach</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/JPG/5b4/162/4a22b256c9a81109b9819bd554.JPG><p><a href=#>Hermann</a> <a href=#>Rorschach</a> was someone who liked to&nbsp;talk and be&nbsp;heard. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;psychoanalyst and psychiatrist of&nbsp;his time and is&nbsp;known today for designing the <a href=#>Rorschach Test</a>. With that face, many patients likely fell madly in&nbsp;love with him&nbsp;— and we&nbsp;certainly wouldn’t judge them.</p><p><h2>8. Almanzo Wilder</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/14a/b92/1093f45ef886796a96b003f3d6.jpg><p>This man is&nbsp;mainly <a href=#>known</a> for being writer <a href=#>Laura Ingalls</a>’ husband, the man that <a href=#>inspired</a> her to&nbsp;write the book, <a href=#>Farmer Boy</a>. And who wouldn’t find inspiration in&nbsp;those bright eyes? He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;farmer and father who, after 20&nbsp;years of&nbsp;work, built a&nbsp;“dream <a href=#>house</a>” for his wife. How romantic! He&nbsp;even accompanied Ingalls to&nbsp;her author events, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;can say that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very humble man, but with a&nbsp;million-dollar heart who knew how to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;woman happy.</p><p><h2>9. James Stark</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/589/1ba/da7d775c51aa6bb0f74f38f9d4.jpg><p><a href=#>James Stark</a> was a&nbsp;distinguished actor from the 19th century. He&nbsp;did theater exclusively, so&nbsp;we&nbsp;only have this photo to&nbsp;appreciate his face. Wouldn’t it&nbsp;be&nbsp;nice to&nbsp;see his smile on&nbsp;the big screen today?</p><p><h2>10. Andrew Irvine</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/593/fe1/06187958a8b31917efdc380f64.jpg><p><a href=#>Andrew</a> was a&nbsp;British mountaineer who loved adventure and extreme sports. It&nbsp;would’ve been the perfect match for any adventurous soul like him. Unfortunately, however, he&nbsp;disappeared on&nbsp;the third British expedition to&nbsp;Mount Everest. No&nbsp;one ever knew if&nbsp;he&nbsp;reached the top.</p><p>His friends <a href=#>said</a>, “Irvine did not live long, but he&nbsp;lived well. Into his short life he&nbsp;crowded an&nbsp;overflowing measure of&nbsp;activity which found its climax in&nbsp;his last wonderful year, a&nbsp;year during which he&nbsp;rowed in&nbsp;the winning Oxford boat, explored Spitsbergen, fell in&nbsp;love with ski-ing, and&nbsp;— perhaps&nbsp;— conquered Everest. The English love rather to&nbsp;live well than to&nbsp;live long.”</p><p><h2>11. Yonejirō Noguchi</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f54/876/9ffec75b6ea5c1a0e8044e8ad3.jpg><p>With his soft features, <a href=#>Noguchi Yonejirō</a> could conquer&nbsp;us both with his face and his words. He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;popular Japanese writer who also lived in&nbsp;the United States and traveled the world, getting to&nbsp;see places like England and France. It&nbsp;sure would have been great to&nbsp;be&nbsp;his traveling companion.</p><p><h2>12. Josef Waitzer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/059/f5a/bc2c1458cab1cde5c46ffddb1c.jpg><p>No, this isn’t the perfect Greek sculpture from <a href=#>The Discobolus</a>. This man really existed and was a&nbsp;German <a href=#>athlete</a> who competed in&nbsp;the 1912&nbsp;Olympics. He&nbsp;was gifted in&nbsp;the javelin and discus throw —and in&nbsp;conquering everyone with his looks.</p><p><h2>13. Francis Parkman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/85c/389/bafc315d03a4977d2bb9e9ae73.jpg><p>Now that we&nbsp;can get a&nbsp;good look at&nbsp;<a href=#>Francis Parkman</a>’s young face, doesn’t he&nbsp;remind you of&nbsp;Joaquin Phoenix, at&nbsp;least a&nbsp;little bit? But he&nbsp;wasn’t an&nbsp;actor, much less an&nbsp;Oscar-winning one. In&nbsp;fact, he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;historian and horticulturist (someone who dedicates time to&nbsp;irrigated orchards) who was born into a&nbsp;wealthy family.</p><p>Despite the opulence, and the temptation to&nbsp;waste his inheritance, he&nbsp;lived modestly using his resources for research. He&nbsp;became a&nbsp;<a href=#>widower</a> at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early age, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;dedicated himself to&nbsp;raising his daughters on&nbsp;his own. And, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;that wasn’t enough, he&nbsp;suffered a&nbsp;neurological illness that impacted him from seeing and walking throughout his life. However, he&nbsp;loved his vocation, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;continue developing professionally.</p><p><h2>14. Anthony Fokker</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/22e/795/6bf7ec5fb8a6ed4864938cdda8.jpg><p>This aircraft <a href=#>builder</a> can get&nbsp;us close to&nbsp;heaven just by&nbsp;looking at&nbsp;his photograph. At&nbsp;age&nbsp;20, he&nbsp;built his first aircraft, and years later, he&nbsp;even had his own aircraft company. We&nbsp;have no&nbsp;doubt that with a&nbsp;face like his, many girls must’ve been longing to&nbsp;be&nbsp;his co-pilot.</p><p><h2>15. Ernest Hemingway</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b85/3a9/1f8e7d5d0fb971dd3729388627.jpg><p>Ernest Hemingway was not only a&nbsp;pretty face, but he&nbsp;was also a&nbsp;successful <a href=#>journalist</a>, novelist, and short-story writer of&nbsp;the twentieth century. Although he&nbsp;was very resolute in&nbsp;his profession, the truth&nbsp;is, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;husband, he&nbsp;was the complete opposite of&nbsp;Almanzo Wilder, who built a&nbsp;house for Laura Ingalls. Hemingway didn’t find happiness with his first wife, nor his second, much less the third. He&nbsp;lived his last days with his fourth wife, with whom he&nbsp;stayed together for 15&nbsp;years until he&nbsp;died in&nbsp;1961.</p><p>Which of&nbsp;these men do&nbsp;you find most attractive?
