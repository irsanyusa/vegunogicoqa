But season 8 is throwing the old format out the window and replacing it with <a href=#>pure cutthroat chaos</a>. Two eliminations every week, 22 contestants, some of the most incredible costumes we’ve seen yet…and the performances haven’t even started yet!</strong></p><p id=block-ec54152b-1089-49da-a7f2-8064eee228ac>If you’ve seen any preview for season 8, the Gopher has probably caught your attention. They’ve been seen thrusting with fire behind them, and just generally bringing the energy. Gopher is a fun one! But who could be under the mask? Read below to find out what we know so far.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCdgJIUsWrk</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-27da0191-d779-4a27-be9c-b2d74ec3694a>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 8</h2><p>The first clues this season have all been given on <a href=#>Instagram</a>. The Gopher’s “mask-ray” showed a lasso, which fits with their cowboy hat and country look. But this costume also looks tall, which could give a hint that the celebrity underneath is someone like an athlete.</p><p>When he walked out, we got the clue that Gopher is an “expert in British politics.” He starts his clues saying he’s an “intergalactic space cowboy who earned his rightful spots in the Hall of Fame.” He’s seen dancing with men and black in colorful wigs. Gopher says he “used his…imagination to start a movement.” He holds a pile of rocks on screen, while talking about “blazing new trails down many old town roads.”</p><p>His “spaceship” was placed in the ultimate Hall of Fame…the Smithsonian! Now “even dogs want to be part of [his] legacy,” then a Corgi takes shape in the stars. A lot of people sample his music, but Gopher has a Grammy to show for his own musical endeavors! The final clue we got was after his performance, a medal with “LOL” written on it over a record.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-4f352515-790c-422a-a895-5110a1a3c01b>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Gopher</h2><p id=block-adeca979-196e-403e-bb95-1765dad45339>The panelists knew this was an iconic, older voice. Jenny predicted it’s Martin Lawrence under the mask. Guest panelist Leslie Jordan said maybe Flava Flav or Lil Nas X. Then, Joel McHale guessed George Wallace, which the audience “didn’t hate.” Robin Thicke pieced clues together and came to the conclusion this could be Sly Stone or George Clinton from Parliament-Funkadelic.</p><p id=block-fac285df-5750-4f52-a7df-fe7a06b9b7d0><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘THE MASKED SINGER’ RETURNS WITH THRILLING FORMAT TWISTS</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eaceb52c-f4c5-482b-8aa5-0e77f63bfe76>Who is the Gopher on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p id=block-4f540236-784e-4f7a-a2cc-07e1b50dc01b>I think we can safely rule out someone super country based on the Gopher’s look and voice, but he didn’t even make it one episode!

He is often credited as being one of the innovators to create funk music. He’s also been given a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award! So cool to see him take on The Masked Singer stage.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_Bride_MaskedSinger_Michael-Becker-_-FOX.jpg alt="Who is the Bride? ‘The Masked Singer’ Prediction & Clues!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer season 8</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZekvamx0Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
