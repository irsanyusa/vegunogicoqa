The condition, known as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lymphedema</a>, can cause excess fluids to&nbsp;collect in&nbsp;the soft tissue of&nbsp;the body and lead to&nbsp;swelling. For Geter, her entire left side of&nbsp;the body is&nbsp;impacted by&nbsp;this, but only her leg is&nbsp;the most <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>visible</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c33/d36/133f9451dba6b351cb29d04575.jpg><p>Geter was diagnosed with the condition right after she was born, and it&nbsp;made it&nbsp;extremely difficult for her to&nbsp;walk. “It&nbsp;drains my&nbsp;energy, of&nbsp;course, because it’s an&nbsp;extra 100&nbsp;pounds,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. The condition makes her more susceptible to&nbsp;contracting <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fibrosis</a>, and the only way to&nbsp;manage it&nbsp;is&nbsp;through physiotherapy and massages to&nbsp;drain the excess fluid in&nbsp;her leg.</p><p><h2>She had a&nbsp;difficult time growing&nbsp;up.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc3/a81/7b9b0852f283fdb00b61e50dca.jpg><p>The model <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>talked</a> about how she faced many difficulties growing&nbsp;up: “I’ve been through a&nbsp;very depressed state because you’re a&nbsp;little kid, and you have a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;grown adults staring at&nbsp;you.” She would receive many unwarranted comments from others and was teased throughout her childhood. “I&nbsp;will say it&nbsp;probably can affect you more mentally and emotionally,” she revealed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/410/347/e41e9a56b0af1dec00070914f2.jpg><p>“As&nbsp;a&nbsp;child, I&nbsp;never felt pretty. I&nbsp;felt ugly, like a&nbsp;freak of&nbsp;nature, and cried in&nbsp;private so&nbsp;many times,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> Geter. She had been suggested surgery by&nbsp;many doctors, but she turned it&nbsp;down every time, stating that in&nbsp;some other, more severe cases, surgery hadn’t completely gotten rid of&nbsp;the growth. Instead, she chose to&nbsp;accept herself as&nbsp;she was.</p><p><h2>She began her modeling journey in&nbsp;2017.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c19/667/8d73315de48e4557841aa75187.jpg><p>Geter’s life changed forever in&nbsp;2017 when she was spotted by&nbsp;a&nbsp;photographer while she was working at&nbsp;Walmart. Initially thinking it&nbsp;was fake, the young woman eventually agreed to&nbsp;let the photographer take pictures of&nbsp;her. “I&nbsp;was like, ’I’m getting older now, maybe it’s time&nbsp;I start putting my&nbsp;full body out there,’ and hopefully me&nbsp;doing that can help somebody else,” she said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd9/af6/81d62f5f8dae991dbb7caad8f4.jpg><p>This one opportunity catapulted Geter’s career as&nbsp;a&nbsp;model. Following this, she was featured in&nbsp;a&nbsp;viral YouTube <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> that amassed over 10&nbsp;million views. Her presence on&nbsp;Instagram and other <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> platforms has also increased. “Mainly, I’ve gotten a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;positive responses, and the ones&nbsp;I like the most are that it&nbsp;helps people that also feel low about themselves,” she said.</p><p><h2>She aims to&nbsp;help others embrace their unique bodies.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c0/65d/aa80d55e7eacfbe31fc42d6a1b.jpg><p>Despite her increased presence on&nbsp;the internet resulting in&nbsp;some Internet trolls, Geter has remained positive throughout, saying, “People have been so&nbsp;nice and supportive of&nbsp;me&nbsp;online. It&nbsp;isn’t all trolling and negativity.” She has remained consistent in&nbsp;spreading body positivity and encouraging others to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more comfortable in&nbsp;their bodies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/cb8/aa4/3162f7522780e6fc0d774b5860.png><p>Geter is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>committed</a> to&nbsp;her dream of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;model. “If&nbsp;I&nbsp;ever make it&nbsp;big, I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;buy my&nbsp;mother a&nbsp;house and take care of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family, then I’ll do&nbsp;everything&nbsp;I can to&nbsp;raise awareness of&nbsp;lymphedema to&nbsp;pay it&nbsp;back to&nbsp;everyone who has ever shown me&nbsp;kindness.” She continues to&nbsp;use her condition to&nbsp;inspire others to&nbsp;celebrate their differences as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>Her journey has inspired many.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f2b/d4a/d1d37f52e5932c73f64846805f.jpg><p>Although Geter’s journey has been hard, she has learned to&nbsp;accept herself and vows to&nbsp;spread this attitude to&nbsp;others. “For the longest, I&nbsp;felt so&nbsp;low about myself, but once&nbsp;I got older and with loads of&nbsp;support from the online lymphedema community and my&nbsp;mom who is&nbsp;my&nbsp;inspiration, I&nbsp;realized how beautiful I&nbsp;am. Not only looks, but as&nbsp;a&nbsp;person.”</p><p>What part of&nbsp;Mahogany Geter’s journey resonated with you the most?
