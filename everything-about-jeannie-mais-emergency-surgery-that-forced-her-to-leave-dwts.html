This led to her announcing she was withdrawing from ‘DWTS’ as it is a very serious condition that needed immediate surgery.</p><p>“I would never imagine ever having to write this, but I made it safely out of my emergency surgery,” she wrote on Instagram. “I will be forever grateful to Dr. Nasseri who identified my potentially life-threatening condition. What simply started as a sore throat had unbeknownst to me become a dangerous infection that already closed at least 60% of my airway and resulted in a throat abscess that spread in a matter of 3 days.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘DANCING WITH THE STARS’: JEANNIE MAI’S WITHDRAWAL CHANGES THE RULES</a></strong></p><p>“Although I am grateful to be recovering safely, I can’t lie… I am devastated by the fact that my journey with&nbsp;#DWTS will end this way” she continued. “Dancing on this show has been the most exhilarating adventure. I’ve gained both beautiful friendships and loving supporters. To my partner,&nbsp;@Brandonarmstrong, I’m sorry you don’t get to make fun of my moves anymore while I gift you life gems on how to be a grown-up.
