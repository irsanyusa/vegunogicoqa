It seems the artist is moving into a new era — and will be taking that snake motif along with her.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a way, Swift has always been associated with snakes: she was born in 1989, the year of the snake by the Chinese zodiac, and even <a href=#>titled her last album</a> 1989. But previously, the slithery symbol was not an association she claimed or wanted as part of her narrative.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Back in June 2016, Swift and DJ Calvin Harris ended their relationship in what seemed an amicable fashion. Soon after, <a href=# rel=noopener>Swift made it public</a> that she had co-written the chart-topping hit “This Is What You Came For” for Harris under a pseudonym. In response, Harris fans soon took to Twitter to start hitting Swift with snake emojis. Snakes are, in biblical mythology and contemporary shorthand, cunning creatures. Some of Swift’s critics who felt the public reveal undermined Harris’s own success used snakes to share their belief that she had serpentine qualities of her own.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Then in February 2016, Kanye West dropped his now-infamous rap song <a href=#>“Famous”</a> off his album <a href=#>The Life of Pablo. </a>One line, in particular, stood out: “I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b—h famous,” he sings. Up to that point, West and Swift had a fraught-turned-friendly history. While West had (notoriously) <a href=#>intercepted her win</a> at the <a href=#>MTV Video Music Awards</a> in 2009, they had afterwards mended fences, even sharing dinner and expressing plans to collaborate.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But after “Famous” came out, Swift condemned the line <a href=#>as misogynistic</a> and expressed that she was not privy to the use of her name in that context. For West’s part, he said he had an “hour long convo with [Taylor] about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In June 2016, Kim Kardashian West further supported her husband’s claim, telling GQ she had footage of a phone conversation in which Swift gave her approval to the lyric. And in July, Kim <a href=#>shared snippets of the taped audio</a> of the phone call in question on her Snapchat story. Swift herself took to Instagram to respond, saying “you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard,” and requested. to be “excluded from this narrative.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The internet erupted into a frenzy. Coined the #KimExposedTaylorParty, Swift once again was bombarded with snake emojis. Feeding the fray, Kim even tweeted (obliquely) about “National Snake Day” in a seeming reference to Swift.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Wait it's legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! 🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍🐍</p>— Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) <a href=#>July 17, 2016</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The snake emojis disappeared soon enough from Swift’s profiles. (Her Instagram account was the platform’s <a href=# rel=noopener>first test case</a> of a filter to remove select words or emojis on certain feeds.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift also began a year-long period of limited public appearances and social media withdrawal, all culminating in the <a href=#>deletion of content</a> off her digital presence last week, the reclamation of the <a href=#>snake imagery</a> (and reinsertion of herself into that narrative) this week and the final announcement of Reputation <a href=#>on Wednesday</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Her first single is expected to drop Thursday at midnight. It’s unclear what role snakes will play in her next steps.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcWFpf3J9jq2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2arnpa4pr%2BMraCmnZyeu6Z7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
