Eric got to meet English professional footballer Mason Mount during the event that they attended.</p><p>The couple and their son are in the first photo in the Instagram post with Stamford and Bridget, the team’s lion mascots. Cowell is wearing a Chelsea FC scarf around his neck while Eric is wearing a Chelsea FC jacket in the photo.</p><p>“I’ve got a good idea of what he’s going to be when he’s older, I think, which is a really cool thing,” Cowell said. “He’s got his own opinion. He’s his own man, which is really, really important. Yeah, he’s a sweetheart.”</p><p>The post also basically confirms that the BGT judge is fine, as last week fans were at the edge of their seats from a BGT act involving Cowell. The incident happened when a masked magician who was auditioning for the show brought <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowell</a> on stage. He reportedly put a hood over the judge’s head, doused it in lighter fluid, and set it on fire. The act left Cowell shocked and a little tensed out but with a sigh of relief, he came out of it unharmed.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Shared Details on Having Another Child</h2><p>There is no doubt that Cowell’s son Eric has brought a big change to his personality and caused him to change from a harsh judge to a softer one. He welcomed Eric with Silverman in 2014, and he’s also a stepfather to his fiancée.</p><p>“It means so much to me as a mom for our son to have a father, and my elder son Adam to have a stepfather who is such an amazing role model in so many ways.” Silverman said.</p><p>Simon addressed the issue of expanding his family in an interview in 2018 where he detailed what it felt like to become a father for the first time. He expressed how much his son Eric meant to him, which is a normal feeling that first-time fathers get.</p><p>“Once you’ve had one you think, how could you imagine him not being here? So when it happens, it happens.” Cowell said. “I can’t really think about life before Eric, so yes I would consider another child.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/CanadasGotTalent_SneakPeek-220x147.jpg alt="‘Canada’s Got Talent’ Teases Shocking Season 2 Audition" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculZKKrXaS4osWMmp2tnaJiv6a8zqurnpycrnqosdOtoKefXaiytXnOp2SfoaKaerC6jJuerWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
