It is hard to believe that he will be celebrating 30 years in the entertainment business next year. He looks the same as he did when he first burst onto the scene in 1993. RuPaul has proved that he is not a one-trick pony throughout his captivating career. From movies, to books, to Rupaul’s Drag Race, the man is a living legend. We are looking at some of RuPaul’s best songs to celebrate his iconic career.</strong></p><p>Although he is a man with many accolades and titles, RuPaul arguably first made it big with the hit “You Better Work.” His music was a sure bet to get any party going, and remains the life of the party today.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-supermodel-you-better-work>‘Supermodel (You Better Work)’</h2><p>RuPaul came in like a wrecking ball and showed the world that he was not to be played with. The entertainer helped to define the 90s with this hit song. The song hit number two on the dance charts and represented the supermodels of the day.</p><p>The inspiration behind the song was RuPaul giving a young Black girl advice on how to make it in the modeling industry. Even in 2022 the song is as popular as ever.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘New Friends Silver, Old Friends Gold’</h2><p>RuPaul’s “New Friends Silver, Old Friends Gold” was released in 2021. The song became an anthem for friendship. The sound showed a more relaxed queen who had lived a life. RuPaul performed the song on the <a href=# class=broken_link>Drag Queens</a> Season 13 finale. Somehow he is able to make the song sparkle by just listening to it. The message of keeping as well as pouring love into your old friends is the cherry on top.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Sissy That Walk’&nbsp;</h2><p>In one of his many empowering anthems, RuPaul told us to “Sissy That Walk.” The song’s message was for those who felt unworthy. The song tells them to “fly” and never give up. Many may not have listened to the lyrics because of the club beat and controversial name of the song, but the message is loud and clear. RuPaul released the single in 2014 and hit the dance charts once again.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Call Me Mother’</h2><p>In this hit, RuPaul demands people address him as “Mother.” His 2017 single was a fun ego trip for the entertainer. He brought sass over a fierce beat. His lyrics included knowing the Clintons as well as the Obamas. He gave haters or anyone coming for his crown a lesson in RuPaul 101. The song earned him another spot on the dance chart.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Don’t Go Breaking My Heart’</h2><p>There was no denying RuPaul’s power early in his career. So much so that Elton John recruited him for John’s duets album. The remake of “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart” was given and electric pop spin when the single was released in 1993. RuPaul’s popularity only grew. John and RuPaul portrayed iconic couples in the video for the song. The Rocket Man and “Mother” was a match made in pop culture heaven.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Kitty Girl’&nbsp;</h2><p>RuPaul returned to the dance charts yet again with “Kitty Girl.” The 2018 track played up to pop nostalgia with heavy drums and an 80’s flare. The song was another chance for RuPaul to sing affirmations for the world to hear. “Kitty Girl” gives permission for outcasts to live freely and unapologetically. The video shows RuPaul reminiscing about his early New York City days and reflecting on how far he has come.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘A Little Bit of Love’</h2><p>It is no secret that not everyone welcomed RuPaul with open arms. It was a testament to his character that he still wanted to spread positive messages in his music. “A Little Bit of Love” was a 90’s song that spoke to the fans who wanted to feel the love. The disco jam was released in 1997 and the video was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/Wo2BR1-CvIU</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘Fashion!’&nbsp;</h2><p>Decades into his career, the power of RuPaul remains. Lady Gaga enlisted him to be featured on her “Fashion!” song during a concert special. The fun song was right up RuPaul’s alley. “Fashion!” spoke to the fashionista in us all.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/NUP_195221_00215-1-1.jpeg alt="Deadly Games’s Alfredo Silva Trades Knives For a Motorcycle in ‘AGT: Extreme’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>rupaul's drag race</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK572KisZpqVqcGmvoywpqujXamurLXNoGSaZZykvKx5wK1kq62glsKtv4ygqZ6ZpJrAtXnSqKWgq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
