The World</a>. This queen is known in the drag world for hosting the series Drag Race Thailand. She is the first queen to host a Drag Race Series and then be a contestant on another show. Will her expertise as a host give her an upperhand in the competition?</strong></p><p>While the other queens have made notable appearances in prior competitions, Heals is going in from an entirely different angle. This queen has been hosting Drag Race Thailand since 2018, but she’s ready to join the competition herself. Pangina Heals is representing her hometown of Bangkok, Thailand on the new series RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Vs. The World.</p><p>Out of drag, Pangina is known as Pan Pan Narpasert. Pan Pan was educated at a British international school and later earned a place at UCLA. He felt pressure to pave a path in life because his parents had money, but openly stated that he wasn’t going to inherit any in the future.</p><p>He got into drag after taking inspiration from Lady Gaga. The first competition he entered was based around the popular singer. The winner of the competition got to see Gaga in concert in New York. Pan Pan won the competition, and continued to compete in drag afterward.</p><p>Pangina Heals came along when RuPaul’s Drag Race had just launched. At the time, no one in Thailand was making a living from the art. Since then she earned the nickname of “the RuPaul of Thailand” simply from her widespread popularly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Has She Ever Competed on a Large Scale?</h2><p>Even though this queen said she hadn’t competed on her preview for RuPaul’s Drag Race UK Vs. The World, she has won a drag television competition in the past. In 2014, she was announced as the winner of T Battle, Thailand’s first reality TV drag competition. She has gained loads of popularity from competing on other reality competition series like Thailand Dance Now and Lip Sync Battle.</p><p>Pangina is known for her dancing, specifically waacking. Waacking is a popular form of street dance that emerged from the LGBTQ+ communities in the disco era. She received her big break when she was appointed as the host of Drag Race Thailand, but her popularity has only increased since. Pangina has been in international publications and even become one of Thailand’s most influential figures. RuPaul fans, we may have a winner already.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/American-Idol-Top-5-American-Idol-Chayce-Beckham-Grace-Kinstler-Willie-Spence-Casey-Bishop-Tricky-Stewart-Ross-Copperman-Ian-Fitchuk-scaled-e1637601981591.jpg alt="Casey Bishop Teases Three Minutes of New Song and Fans are Obsessed" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57z5qloKGelnqpscClqmaeoqS6brTOrKtmrJ9ivraxxKdkraddl7KiwIyopWaqpaWutrjSZpurmZdiv6KvxGaspGWmqHq1tMRmrqiqnJl8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
