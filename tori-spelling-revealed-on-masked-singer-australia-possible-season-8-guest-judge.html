She also spoke about how her singing was received when she was younger, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">saying</a>, “When I was little, someone told me I was tone deaf so I gave up.&nbsp;I gave up that dream&nbsp;but I always loved it in my heart.”</p><p>The actress posted highlights from her time on the show to Instagram, writing in the caption, “Being on Masked Singer has allowed me to become the confident human I’ve always wanted to be.”</p><p>She shared that she’s always been seen as “a name, a face, someone’s daughter, and a character.” Spelling added, “It almost seems at times that I’m not allowed to be talented because of who I am. The life I was born into. The mask allows me to hide me yet be me so completely.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=#>FANS PRAISE NEW ‘THE MASKED SINGER AUSTRALIA’ COSTUMES FOR NEXT SEASON</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-spelling-could-be-a-guest-judge-on-season-8-in-the-u-s>Spelling Could Be a Guest Judge on Season 8 in the U.S.</h2><p>Her time on the Australian version of the show wasn’t Spelling’s only appearance on The Masked Singer.
