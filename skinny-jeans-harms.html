Throughout the day, she felt her jeans get increasingly tight, until, while walking home in the evening, her feet went numb and she fell. Not able to get up, she spent several hours on the ground before she was taken to the hospital.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There, her legs and ankles had become so swollen that emergency room staff had to cut her jeans off. Her ankles and toes were weak, but the rest of her legs, including her knees and hips, were working normally.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When the doctors did studies on how her leg nerves were functioning, they found blockage of the nerve that directs the lower leg and feet. In fact, they say, any compression of the area just under knee can squeeze this nerve and cause weakness, numbness or pain by damaging this nerve. In her case, the squatting probably squashed the nerves feeding into each leg, and the skinny jeans didn’t help when the swelling started, further constricting them and crushing the nerves. After four days in the hospital with IV hydration, the bloating went down and the woman could walk again on her own.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lesson: don’t wear skinny jeans if you’re going to do a lot of squatting or bending. They might not directly pinch the nerves in your legs but they can make the condition worse — enough to numb your feet and require several days in the hospital.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZscWNlgnaEjqyioqaernqrscCnqmagkae6tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
