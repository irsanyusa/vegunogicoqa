Particularly, the singer talked about her cruel and tough experiences as a woman who went through divorce. Noting how rough the journey was, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> mentioned that this has become the subject of her upcoming album.</p><p>“Every phase is on my record,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “There is sadness, there is rage. There’s a lot.”</p><p>As stated by the “Breakaway” singer, it was imperative for her to hit all those emotions to actually feel the pain of her separation.</p><p>“I sometimes run across people and they’re like, ‘oh I felt like, you know, fine’ and I was just like, ‘wait, what?’ I was destroyed, like on the ground, like crying. Because that’s a loss, it’s a death. Honestly, you grieve something that you thought would be forever,” she said.</p><p>At the moment, no further details about the album have been announced yet. This will, however, mark <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson’s</a> first major studio album in more than five years, following 2017’s Meaning of Life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-gives-advice-to-women-moving-on-from-trenches-of-hurt>She Gives Advice to Women Moving On From “Trenches of Hurt”</h2><p>Elsewhere in the podcast, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> took the time to share her thoughts about women going through and moving on from divorce. She went on and stated that each person has a unique way of dealing with the situation.</p><p>“I know nothing about your relationship,” she said. “People can see from the outside but if you’re not in the relationship, you don’t know it. Sometimes, what I did is not the answer for everyone.”</p><p>Furthermore, the “Stronger” hitmaker mentioned the importance of the people “you surround yourself with.” Clarkson most especially credits the help of her therapist who gave her the tools she didn’t know she needed.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Original_BenLapidus_Steve-GranitzWireImage-220x147.jpeg alt="‘AGT’ Star Ben Lapidus Releases Music Video for New Song ‘Better Angels’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Kelly Clarkson</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yp6jpbFdmLmivsqspqdlo5bGtHnHnqlmraCYvK61zaBkmqSSqrpur86mp6uho5rAbrHVnqmyZaCdrrSxjKidZqCVp3qltdWoqZydXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
