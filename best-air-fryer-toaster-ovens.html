Our testers included families of four, couples and single dwellers. We asked them to review every aspect of their experience, including unboxing, setting up and cooking. We asked each tester to test out a variety of recipes and functions to be able to provide a thorough review of the product itself. To land at the best-of-the-best, we considered many factors, including set-up and use, reliability, cooking features, flavor, expectations, and budget.</p><h2 id=what-to-look-for-when-buying-an-air-fryer-toaster-oven>What to look for when buying an air fryer toaster oven:</h2><p>I first spoke with Chef Claude Booker, the president of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Soul Food Starters</a>, for his advice on selecting the best air fryer for your needs. Here, he provided some shopping tips to narrow down your search:</p><h3>Consider your needs</h3><p>Are you someone who makes large portions at once or do you cook each night while keeping it simple? Are you looking for a basic air fryer or do you want multiple cooking options? While Booker recommends sticking to the basics for your first purchase, air fryers come in many shapes, sizes and price ranges, so it’s important to determine how you’ll use it before you buy it.</p><h3>Amount of space</h3><p>Booker says it’s vital to consider your counter space as this appliance may live on your countertop for an extended time. “A smaller and compact countertop air fryer will achieve the main purpose of creating golden brown and crisp foods,” he says.</p><h3>Range of features</h3><p>Lastly, Booker urges shoppers to review the maker's website and learn the various recipes and items you can cook with the model you want to purchase. This will help you better understand the capabilities.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>How do air fryers work?</h3><p>Booker says an air fryer can be your best friend if you follow these three easy steps:</p><h3>Preheat your air fryer</h3><p>Starting from cold can cause the item not to crisp up. Instead, the air fryer works like an oven but with top-down radiant heat applied. The same principles of baking apply to the air fryer. Can you fry it without preheating it? Yes, you can— but the tip of preheating provides that fried-in-oil experience. While some machines do offer no preheating time, Booker still recommends giving the machine time to warm up before placing food inside.</p><h3>Space out the items you are cooking in the air fryer</h3><p>Booker explains by spreading out the items, the air circulates properly and causes a better air fry. If the items are touching, they typically stay a bit moist.</p><h3>Consider foil use</h3><p>If you are looking to bake and at the same time get the extracted juice and deglaze, rendering aluminum foil under the product is a good option. If you want to reduce clean up, aluminum foil placed under the vented tray can prevent juices from sticking to the bottom. However, if you’re going for a super crispy finish, then foil is not needed.</p><h3>What is the difference between a regular air fryer and a toaster oven air fryer?</h3><p>“In the past, it would have been very easy to answer this question because a toaster oven provides radiant heat only, it operated like an oven,” Booker says. “The radiant heat with convection and top and below heat. I have both in my home kitchen, and they all have a place.”</p><h3>What can an air fryer toaster oven do?</h3><p>What is an air fryer and what can it do? The better question is, what can’t it do? Even small air fryers that fit easily between your choice of <a rel=alternate href=#>best coffee makers</a> or <a rel=alternate href=#>best espresso machines</a> on your counter, are a great addition to your kitchen. Here, Booker shares his top recommendations for foods to try in the air fryer toaster oven:</p><h4>Bagels:</h4><p>Simply load the bagel and you get a perfectly toasted bagel in two minutes. The crumbs and burnt residue that typically come from a toaster is a thing of the past when you toast in the air fryer.</p><h4>Leftover fried items:</h4><p>These are brought back to life when using an air fryer. It will crisp up in minutes! Any leftover takeout items like egg rolls, fried fish or fried chicken. This is better than a microwave since a microwave only heats and doesn’t crisp.</p><h4>Leftover pizza:</h4><p>Air fryers have top-down radiant heat combined with the air, so it heats the cheese and the bottom crust in just a few minutes. Unfortunately, the oven is a little too slow and does not combine the top-down heat that the compact air fryer gives you, Booker adds.</p><h4>Hand-cut French fries:</h4><p>Booker says with a light spray of your favorite oil, hand-cut French fries will taste like you deep-fried them</p><p>The information presented here is created by TIME Stamped and overseen by TIME editorial staff.
