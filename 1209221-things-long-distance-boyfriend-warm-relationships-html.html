But that doesn't have to be true. Even though you can't physically touch each other, there are still so many things you can do with each other in a long-distance relationship. Here are some things to say to your new boyfriend when your long distance.</p><ul><li>Love is everything it's cracked up to be. It is worth fighting for, being brave for, and risking everything for.</li><li>Being someone's first love may be great, but to be their last is beyond perfect.</li><li>The world's best and most beautiful things cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart. That's the way I think of you. I cherish you too much to let go because now I know what true happiness feels like.</li><li>Sometimes, the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than those beside you.</li><li>Love is not just being with someone. Love is feeling someone even if miles separate you. It's looking at photos of them. Listening to their voicemails, remembering the times you laughed together, got mad, and cried together.</li><li>You never realise these little moments' importance until they're gone. Long-distance relationships take time and effort, but once you find someone who loves you as unconditionally as this, why would you ever want to stop?</li><li>I don't care how far we live apart or how many hours a day we spend on the phone. You're always here with me.</li><li>True love doesn't ask you to sacrifice yourself. You can love someone from a distance and still live in the moment.</li><li>Distance teaches us to appreciate the days that we can spend together and distance teaches us the definition of patience. It is a reminder that every moment together is unique, and every second should be cherished.</li><li>If I could choose between loving you for four months and living without you for four months, I'd rather have the latter.</li><li>The thought of seeing you soon makes me happier than anything else in the world. When I think about you, my stomach gets all fluttery inside like a thousand butterflies taking flight all at once.</li><li>Spending any amount of time with you is the highlight of my life. You're one of the best things that have happened to me for so long.</li><li>Every night before bed, I look at our picture next to my bedside table and imagine our future together - what it'll be like when I finally hug you again and kiss your lips passionately. I hope you feel the same way too.</li><li>I'll be waiting for you here with open arms.</li><li>You are my inspiration, and I couldn't imagine anyone more perfect to share my life with.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/25a0fd8210c6a483.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Romantic love messages for him to send to him when he is away</span></p></a><h2>Inspirational message for long distance relationship</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f9beff43f7cbc060.jpg><p class=align-left>An inspirational text is necessary for people in a long-distance relationship.

There is so much goodness that we shared together.</li><li>Remember that I love you no matter what and always think about our future together.</li><li>I don't cry because we've been separated by distance for years. Why? Because for as long as we share the same sky and breathe the same air, we're still together.</li><li>No day goes by without me missing you.</li><li>My love, thanks for always being with me even when we are miles apart.

But make sure you are not doing it too much. Having some time apart can be healthy because it forces you to live life without each other and figure out who you are as an individual. Here are some freaky things to say to your long-distance boyfriend.</p><ul><li>I was so bored at work, so I started fantasising about what it would be like if you kidnapped me. I had to take a break and go to the ladies' room.</li><li>I just dreamt about you last night. I miss talking to you all day, every day. It's hard sometimes, but I know we're in this together. You're my best friend, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for us.</li><li>Seeing your face after days of no contact is always the best feeling.</li><li>I had the funniest thought today. I imagined we were in the middle of an argument, and you were pissed off at me, so I dropped to my knees and started bl*wing you.</li><li>I had a dream last night that we were on a plane travelling someplace exotic, and it was dark, and we were cuddling under a blanket, and you won't believe what happened next.</li><li>Sometimes, I think if only you were here with me, I would never have any worries again.</li><li>My heart aches when we're apart, and it feels so good to see you again and get lost in each other.</li><li>When I see you, I'm going to be so hard I'll probably beg you to f*ck me right in the car before we even get to your place, but I want you to control my org*sm and tell me I can't come until you permit me to. Would you like that?</li><li>I have always wanted to have s*x in front of the mirror and me spanking your delicious a*s.</li><li>I get so turned on when you tell me what you will do with my body and how you will use me.</li><li>I love hearing about your kinks, but please don't share them with anyone else. They're just between you and me.</li><li>The most int*mate moment for me is when I feel entirely connected to you- it doesn't matter if it's via phone or in person- it just knows that no matter what happens, you'll still be by my side.</li><li>Whenever I'm away from home and lonely, I put on my shirt or underwear and sleep hugging a pillow so I can pretend it's yours.</li><li>I swear I could smell you on the fabric, which made me crave your touch even more.</li><li>And now, whenever I feel depressed or sad, it's impossible for me not to smile because every time I close my eyes, all I see is a future full of happiness with you by my side.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/61499dcd721c9e58.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Discover some interesting cute things to say to your girlfriend</span></p></a><h2>How do I show my boyfriend I love him in a long-distance relationship?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/421201c549cf9f74.jpg><p class=align-left>There are several ways you can show your love for your boyfriend in a long-distance relationship. Keep this list handy when you want to get in touch with your guy.</p><ul><li>Regular phone calls and texts are excellent ways to stay connected.</li><li>Sending <a href=#>funny messages</a> or emojis is another excellent way to keep things light and playful between you.</li><li>Try surprising him with something he loves: tickets, concert passes, shirts from his favourite sports team, or even something simple like dinner at his favourite restaurant back home or pictures of his favourite dessert.</li><li>You should also be open and honest about how much you miss him and how excited you are when he comes home.</li><li>Share pictures and tag your partner in them if you have one.</li><li>Send cute letters expressing what you're feeling and what's going on with you while they're away.</li><li>Be committed to finding time to spend together as often as possible--even if it's only for a few minutes.</li><li>Talk about physical touch (like cuddling) before you see each other again, so there isn't any pressure to do so when he arrives.</li><li>Plan a surprise visit.</li><li>Remind him of why you fell in love with him in the first place! Remind him of all your happy memories and why you'll always have feelings for him no matter where he is.</li><li>Try video chatting whenever you can.
