She has lots of&nbsp;serious injuries, and Edward tells her that they need to&nbsp;break up&nbsp;and that she should go&nbsp;to&nbsp;her mother.</p><p>But if&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;the heart monitor, you will see a&nbsp;steady <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heart</a> rate, as&nbsp;if&nbsp;Bella is&nbsp;resting perfectly.</p><p><h2>Alice’s scarf changes its knots.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f9/893/7a452358ce9a27d8ea39b55803.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the second film, there’s a&nbsp;scene where Alice runs up&nbsp;to&nbsp;Bella to&nbsp;congratulate her on&nbsp;her birthday. Alice is&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;fabulous scarf. But, every time the camera shows Alice, the scarf is&nbsp;tied <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>uniquely</a> (and differently).</p><p><h2>Vampires are supposed to&nbsp;have superpowers, but some Cullens don’t have any.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/421/37d/ff558455b9ba3133dd58b26c6a.jpg><p>The talent a&nbsp;person gets when they are born becomes a&nbsp;hundred times more powerful when they turn into a&nbsp;vampire. For example, sensitive <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Edward</a> starts reading people’s minds, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Alice’s</a> instincts help her see the future. But some characters don’t seem to&nbsp;have any vampire talents, like Carlisle, Emmet, or&nbsp;Rosalie.</p><p>In&nbsp;fact, they do&nbsp;have certain powers. So, Carlisle <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>became</a> the first “vegetarian” among vampires. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the only vampire that doesn’t react to&nbsp;the smell of&nbsp;human blood. Emmet has incredible physical <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>power</a>. And Rosalie is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>beautiful</a> and has eyes the color of&nbsp;violets.</p><p>These things are highlighted in&nbsp;the books but aren’t mentioned in&nbsp;the movies.</p><p><h2>Bella is&nbsp;reading a&nbsp;book she forgot in&nbsp;Edward’s car.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2ae/f26/2dd4a85a3a8099010f6487f975.jpg><p>To&nbsp;find out who this Cullen is, Bella goes into a&nbsp;bookstore where she buys a&nbsp;book about the origin of&nbsp;werewolves and vampires. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>puts</a> it&nbsp;into her bag.</p><p>Later, Bella meets Edward, and they have dinner together. Then, he&nbsp;drives her to&nbsp;her father’s house. When she says goodbye to&nbsp;Edward, Bella is&nbsp;not carrying her bag, which means she has left it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the car. But then, the bag magically appears at&nbsp;her home, and she is&nbsp;shown reading the book.</p><p><h2>The Cullens have such an&nbsp;acute reaction to&nbsp;blood that they would have been detected long ago.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9e5/11d/6f72065da493ebece593162082.jpg><p>Even though the Cullens are “vegetarians” in&nbsp;the vampire world, it’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hard</a> for them to&nbsp;fight the craving from time to&nbsp;time. Remember the scene when Jasper couldn’t stop himself when Bella cut her finger on&nbsp;the paper?</p><p>With this weak “willpower,” their secret would have been revealed long ago. They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>live</a> among people and in&nbsp;public places, so&nbsp;there would be&nbsp;too many temptations.</p><p><h2>Bella is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;close to&nbsp;her mom, but she almost doesn’t talk to&nbsp;her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/069/f89/74eab456dca81a74a077806fa0.png><p>The story starts when Bella moves in&nbsp;with her father. They are <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>awkward</a> around each other and don’t know each other very well. Bella’s parents divorced a&nbsp;long time ago, and Bella lived with her mom all this time. Her mom didn’t date anyone, so&nbsp;they were supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;close.</p><p>But in&nbsp;the entire franchise, we&nbsp;only see a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;phone calls. And they only meet on&nbsp;special occasions: when Bella is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>hospital</a> or&nbsp;when she gets <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>married</a>. Nothing changes, even when Bella gets pregnant. At&nbsp;the same time, her dad was extremely <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worried</a> about her. And when Bella became a&nbsp;vampire, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>never saw</a> her mom again.</p><p><h2>Edward wears sunglasses, which are pretty useless for him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/393/f6f/f5733c5969b35b7c2395ebbac1.jpg><p>As&nbsp;you know, the vampires in&nbsp;<i>Twilight</i> sparkle in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sunlight</a>. So, to&nbsp;keep regular people from figuring out what they are, they try not to&nbsp;appear outside when it’s sunny. So, Edward has no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;have sunglasses. Maybe, he&nbsp;just wants to&nbsp;look cool.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, vampires regularly appear outside in&nbsp;daylight, but they don’t always sparkle. It&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>seems</a> that they sparkle only when the story requires&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Another one of&nbsp;Bella’s books mysteriously disappears and reappears.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/81b/779/76f40a5b3c80a4949fab5af2e5.jpg><p>When the character wakes up&nbsp;at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the <i>New Moon</i>, she has a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>copy</a> of<i>&nbsp;Romeo and Juliet </i>next to&nbsp;her. At&nbsp;that moment, Bella’s dad enters the room with a&nbsp;birthday gift. There was no&nbsp;time for Bella to&nbsp;put the book away, but it&nbsp;disappeared anyway. And in&nbsp;the next scene, it’s on&nbsp;the bed again.</p><p><h2>Edward decided to&nbsp;leave Bella “honorably” when nothing special happened.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b13/7ef/13c9c85a2585dae0f3b0e3e7cb.jpg><p>Edward put Bella in&nbsp;danger an&nbsp;incredible number of&nbsp;times. But for some reason, Jasper’s weakness when he&nbsp;attacked Bella made him feel it&nbsp;was necessary to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>break up</a>&nbsp;with her. Jasper was pulled away by&nbsp;other <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> members, and he&nbsp;meant no&nbsp;harm.</p><p>But Edward left Bella when she was particularly attached to&nbsp;him. He&nbsp;could have left her way before if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;good guy. For example, when Bella almost died after James’ attack.</p><p><h2>Bella calls Rosalie without even dialing her number.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b51/e84/4cd8e855a4b3815bcce10cb73f.jpg><p>When Bella realizes she’s pregnant, she and Edward return home. On&nbsp;their way to&nbsp;the airport, she calls Rosalie. But when she turned on&nbsp;her phone, she didn’t <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dial</a> the number or&nbsp;search for it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the phone book. She just puts the phone to&nbsp;her ear. You can even see the screen lock when they’re talking.</p><p><h2>When Edward stops the car, saving Bella, she has enough time to&nbsp;fix her hair.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/02d/91e/c26a135e7a8134ac0550206e94.jpg><p>You probably remember the romantic scene where Edward rushes to&nbsp;Bella and saves her from the car that almost hits her. She was lying on&nbsp;the ground, shocked. In&nbsp;this condition, she wouldn’t have been able to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything about her hair. But at&nbsp;first, we&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>see</a> it&nbsp;loose on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;her jacket, and then, it’s tucked into her clothes.</p><p><h2>We&nbsp;don’t understand how Bella got pregnant by&nbsp;a&nbsp;vampire.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/896/256/8c4f4853199796a1f46f2945b2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the third film, Rosalie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentions</a> that she wants to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;baby and that she’s sorry that she and Emmet can’t have kids. If&nbsp;it’s about the biological features of&nbsp;vampires, then how could Edward conceive a&nbsp;baby?</p><p>Stephenie Meyer, the author of&nbsp;the books, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explains</a> this moment by&nbsp;saying that vampires have fluid in&nbsp;their veins, similar to&nbsp;human blood. Their bodies still have some functions&nbsp;— for example, men can conceive.</p><p>At&nbsp;the same time, a&nbsp;female body <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>can’t get pregnant</a> because it&nbsp;can’t adapt to&nbsp;the growing fetus. The movies don’t have these explanations.</p><p>What other inconsistencies did you notice when watching the saga?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5zedOwoKWhl53Bbq7LrqWdnaKoerixjKagrKuVmXqmwsSnZJqepJq%2FbsPArZqhoZ6cerW0xGaqmp%2BRYrGwxsSnqmanlmLBqrnErGRxaWBtfnV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
