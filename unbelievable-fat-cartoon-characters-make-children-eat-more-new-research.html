Campell</strong>, children have a "tendency to eat almost twice as much indulgent food as kids who are exposed to perceived healthier looking cartoon characters or no characters at all".</p><p>It also found that the tendency to munch on junk food was curtailed if the children had to draw on their health knowledge before watching the cartoons.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Some children were given 6 pairs of pictures and words and asked to pick the healthiest option. They then watched a cartoon featuring a character considered to be fat, before being offered cookies.</p><p>The results showed that the children who had participated in the health test ate fewer cookies than the children who had simply just watched the cartoon.</p><p>According to Campbell, "because research like this is new; looking at kids and stereotyping particularly of cartoon characters - we weren't sure whether kids would be aware of bodyweight norms. But surprisingly, they apply typically human standards to cartoon characters - creatures for which there isn't a real baseline."</p><p>Campbell added that it was important to keep exploring, saying "if we're able to help trigger their health knowledge with a quiz just as they're about to select lunch at school, for instance, they'll choose the more nutritious foods."</p><p>Also, she expressed hope that her research will encourage companies to be "more responsible with their own marketing choices" citing <strong>Frosties</strong> mascot, <strong>'Tony the Tiger'</strong>, which was redesigned several years ago to look slimmer and more athletic.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0mijqJuRoXy2usGeo6KdppavrbGMn5itZZOWv7W7zqdknKCRp66kwMSrqmalkaCybq%2FHoqOdqpWjeqat02akqKqVYrumw4yrnKydkaewqXuPcKhpnZ1r</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
