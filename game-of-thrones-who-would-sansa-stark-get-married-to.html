The story is complicated, with Ramsay gone and Tyrion half way across to Westeros as the hand of the queen, we are left with <strong>Littlefinger</strong>.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Ramsay is dead, we are left with Littlefinger and Tyrion Lannister, till a new character pops up!</p><p>1. <strong>Tyrion Lannister</strong></p><p>Well our inner minds tell us that Daenerys would win the war in Westeros, which automatically makes Tyrion Lannister the Hand of the Queen for the Seven Kingdoms. He needs a bride.</p><p>Did he ever love Sansa? Or does he want to stay married to Sansa [they are officially married]?</p><p>We believe the duo [Sansa and Tyrion] were starting to like each other before the death of Jeoffrey separated them. This means they are still legally married!</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>2. <strong>Littlefinger</strong></p><p>You all would agree that Littlefinger is the King in the game of chess. Though he tells people not to trust him [which they end up doing] he doesn't look like the culprit but always ignites the fire of war between his enemies.</p><p>He was in love with Sansa's mom and has professed his love for Sansa several times, but we are not certain they would end up together.</p><p>Who do you think she would end up with? Tyrion Lannister, the hand of the Queen or Littlefinger, the King of the chess game.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Share your comments in the comment section below;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdktKq%2F02inqKhdmMKtwNSrnGifkaKybrvFZquhqp%2BjsrR51qGmZq%2BfqrmledKapayZXajBor7KZp6erF2irrO%2ByJ6bZqyfZLu7ttanqJs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
