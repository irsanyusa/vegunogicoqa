Later on Friday, <a href=# id=18b7c381-805e-5f71-881a-cfe3bb925e92>ESPN's Ian Begley reported</a> that Porzingis skipped his exit meeting with Jackson out of frustration over the "dysfunction" and "drama" surrounding the team. In fact, the unhappiness around the team may be widespread.</p><p>According to Wojnarowski, Porzingis has taken note of how other more successful organizations are run and believes the Knicks aren't giving him the proper platform to become a future face of the franchise. Wojnarowski reports that Porzingis is also returning to Latvia this summer and may not return to New York until closer to training camp.</p><p>Additionally, players around the team are reportedly "fuming" about the team's plans to hold summer sessions to install the triangle. Many Knicks players don't like the system, which has largely proven to be antiquated in today's NBA. Head coach Jeff Hornacek was never given the freedom to install his own system, and according to Wojnarowski, players question the allegiance of assistant coach Kurt Rambis, who was a Jackson hire and Jackson's leading candidate to become head coach before the plan was thwarted.</p><p>In general, Wojnarowski paints a picture of large-scale unhappiness:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Inside and outside the Knicks, people see a franchise in disrepair: Jackson’s open war with Anthony, the failed trade for Derrick Rose and the $72 million contract albatross of a broken-down Joakim Noah. Players grumble of a support staff that is far more concerned about creating an illusion of hard work with management and ownership than facilitating winning, a media-relations staff that is suffocating and intrusive, and a management/coaching dynamic that’s made Hornacek look like a puppet."</p><p>Wojnarowski reports that Jackson's blunt comments about Anthony's future with the team only make Anthony want to dig in and wait out Jackson's remaining two years. Anthony holds a no-trade clause that allows him to approve or disapprove any trade in which he's involved.</p><p>Anthony actually took a step to fire back at Jackson on Saturday, with the NBA Player Association releasing a scathing statement over Jackson's comments. Anthony is the NBPA vice president.</p><p>"We voiced with the Commissioner today our view on the inappropriate comments by Knicks President Phil Jackson. If players under contract cannot, under threat of league discipline, speak openly about their desire to be employed elsewhere, we expect management to adhere to the same standards. The door swings both ways when it comes to demonstrating loyalty and respect."</p><p>Facing a rebuild, the Knicks could not be in a worse position. They have an ill-suited mix of veterans and young players who haven't proven capable of playing together, a coach without the freedom to coach how he likes, a president the players don't like, an unhappy star player, and unhappy future face of the franchise.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Jackson and Anthony's feud will be settled one way or another. But the worst-case scenario for the Knicks is that Jackson pushes Porzingis away and turns the Knicks into a franchise players don't want to join. The latter appears closer than ever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70qmmq6yjZMCxu9Gtqmajnp6wrL%2BMqaOasZWnwG6t0Z5koqZdpL2muoyrnJudnKG2sLqMqJ1mrJiaerWxwKaqZpyZqLCwvsNmmKecXZnGtLLUp5qtoZ%2BjeqK%2Fjp2pbbCqan0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
