Shelton acknowledges that The Voice made the wrong decision on Combs.</p><p>As someone who recognizes Combs as a great singer, <a href=# class=broken_link>Shelton</a> admits his embarrassment that the show couldn’t do the same. The coach goes on to say that Combs was the one who told him that story, and he couldn’t believe it. To clarify, Combs did not earn the opportunity to audition for the coaches, so Shelton could not speak on his individual audition.</p><p>“He told me that story… there’s no way around it, it’s embarrassing. Let’s just face it.” Shelton said about the show turning down Combs’ audition.</p><p>Seeing the country singer’s success today make you wonder what <a href=#>The Voice</a> producers were thinking when they rejected him. As it turns out though, the show turning him down ultimately helped propel his career to new heights.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Combs Kept the Rejection Letter He Received</h2><p>Combs is now considered a mega-star in country-style music, having been nominated for a Grammy Award. Before Combs achieved worldwide fame, he once auditioned on the NBC singing competition The Voice.</p><p>He revealed that he was on spring break a few years ago when&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;was having auditions in Atlanta, Georgia. Initially making it through the first round with the producers, Combs was hopeful he will get a shot at making it to the show.</p><p>After waiting for a few months, he got a letter from the show stating that he is a great singer. Unfortunately, the show’s producers deemed that he wasn’t interesting enough for the show’s ratings. The letdown sparked new motivation for Combs as he has something to prove to the people that rejected him.</p><p>Combs revealed that he kept the letter in his dorm room in college and he hung it on the wall to push him on. In present day, Combs is a six-time CMA Award winner and reigning Entertainer of the Year. The country artist also has a multitude of other accolades.</p><p>His latest album Growin’ Up, debuted at number one on Billboard’s Top Country Albums chart this past June. As it turns out, Combs didn’t need The Voice to become one of the most popular artists in country music.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_TaylorSwift_Terry-WyattGetty-Images.jpg alt="Taylor Swift Might Be Next Year’s Super Bowl Halftime Performer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>blake shelton</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Voice</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waWYpJ1dqLWmuNOopWaroJqurL%2BMqKytZZGXvLbAjK2fnmWmpLaksYyrnKOdk6m2r7OMpayknV2YvK6u0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
