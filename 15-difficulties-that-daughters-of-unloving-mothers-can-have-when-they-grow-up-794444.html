We at Bright Side feel that it is important to know the kinds of troubles daughters of terrible mothers might face later in life.
1. They could lack the ability to trust.
Unloving mothers would have scolded their daughters for reacting in certain ways, making these girls unable to trust others with their emotions."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They could lack the ability to&nbsp;trust.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/656/15a/480fc458a0868f07bc123149d7.jpg><p>Unloving mothers would have scolded their daughters for reacting in&nbsp;certain ways, making these girls unable to&nbsp;trust others with their emotions. Feeling betrayed by&nbsp;the one person that they should be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;rely&nbsp;on, these girls would be&nbsp;more less trusting of&nbsp;other people.</p><p><h2>2. They could lack self-confidence.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/60b/b0c/75eba95301b5a82a8c798648a5.jpg><p>Growing up&nbsp;with mothers who constantly criticized them and ignored them, these daughters are likely to&nbsp;believe their mothers’ condescending words. They might think that their accomplishments and talents are nothing to&nbsp;be&nbsp;proud&nbsp;of. They would believe that they don’t matter much.</p><p><h2>3. They could feel that they don’t deserve love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64a/830/fa812c5a5b8235ac05c319ddff.jpg><p>If&nbsp;their own mothers who give birth to&nbsp;them and raised them find it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;love them, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;understandable that they might feel like they don’t actually deserve love. They would feel as&nbsp;if&nbsp;nobody could ever love them because they are broken and not worth&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>4. They could be&nbsp;unable to&nbsp;say “no.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/967/a77/426e6256da8c589146cf258e7e.png><p>Daughters of&nbsp;abusive mothers would be&nbsp;unable to&nbsp;refuse any demands and favors because they are used to&nbsp;being told to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;accepted by&nbsp;their mothers. They would think that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;natural to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things for others even when they don’t want&nbsp;to, just to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;the good graces of&nbsp;others.</p><p><h2>5. They could feel like they don’t belong anywhere.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/32f/4e3/811dfc5094b4ca1a5e7757b4db.jpg><p>Manipulative or&nbsp;abusive mothers would have robbed their daughters of&nbsp;their sense of&nbsp;belonging. The girls would feel like their own home wasn’t meant for them. They would not feel safe or&nbsp;wanted. It&nbsp;would be&nbsp;difficult for them to&nbsp;imagine feeling like they belong anywhere else in&nbsp;the world.</p><p><h2>6. They could have difficulties with boundaries.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d3f/bc1/a513ce5777bc2522785ff03216.jpg><p>Without the love from their mothers, these girls may find it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;maintain close friendships, especially with other girls. They might even try to&nbsp;please others so&nbsp;much that they end up&nbsp;being used instead of&nbsp;being in&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy relationship. Some of&nbsp;them might even feel so&nbsp;intensely about a&nbsp;relationship that the other person backs off.</p><p><h2>7. They could feel dominated by&nbsp;a&nbsp;fear of&nbsp;failure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f67/10a/3ba70d5f6f92d249fcde2b9e82.jpg><p>Being fed negative words and treatment as&nbsp;kids, daughters who are not loved by&nbsp;their mothers would be&nbsp;scared of&nbsp;trying their best at&nbsp;anything. They fear getting the same rejection their mothers so&nbsp;often give them. Unloved daughters are likely to&nbsp;become under-achievers because of&nbsp;this.</p><p><h2>8. The could have difficulties seeing themselves for who they really are.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/483/b47/9519ad50f290c29aad82935367.jpg><p>Because they have mothers who are always telling them how little and unimportant they are, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;surprise that they would see themselves for how their mothers see them. They would think that there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;use in&nbsp;trying hard because their mothers would have given them the idea that they are not capable of&nbsp;anything. They might feel ugly looking into the mirror because they have a&nbsp;distorted version of&nbsp;themselves.</p><p><h2>9. They could be&nbsp;overly-sensitive.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a0a/d1a/88f05e5bd388a146ac65166d52.jpg><p>These daughters could be&nbsp;way too sensitive to&nbsp;the smallest comments or&nbsp;gestures anyone makes. They would overthink and worry about things, when the other person means nothing by&nbsp;them. This is&nbsp;possibly because they are used to&nbsp;being told off by&nbsp;their mothers for having reactions to&nbsp;anything.</p><p><h2>10. They could have trouble choosing friends and partners who are not toxic.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6a/697/4cb64458c3b26a99e2f2b4c2c6.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;normal to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;recreate a&nbsp;similar kind of&nbsp;relationship or&nbsp;friendship that is&nbsp;like the familiar relationship you have with your family. But this is&nbsp;bad for daughters of&nbsp;unloving mothers because they are likely to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;relationship with people who are not good for them. They would be&nbsp;way too eager to&nbsp;please and take on&nbsp;abuse from other people, the way they do&nbsp;with their own mothers.</p><p><h2>11. They could feel insecure.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/61e/e10/06878656d6bb5b9a3aeaaa924d.jpg><p>Children of&nbsp;emotionally unreliable mothers would feel insecure because sometimes they receive the connection they seek, but sometimes they don’t. Growing&nbsp;up, some of&nbsp;these daughters would avoid intimacy altogether, while some would try hard but never stop feeling anxious and insecure.</p><p><h2>12. They might never believe they can succeed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dd0/d84/e38d49539cbf614c633e6f1ffd.jpg><p>Having mothers who would scoff at&nbsp;them every time they tried to&nbsp;achieve something, these daughters would feel like they are not good enough to&nbsp;be&nbsp;successful at&nbsp;anything. They would believe that success stories can never be&nbsp;theirs.</p><p><h2>13. They blame themselves for being treated badly by&nbsp;others.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ad5/c70/9b43da59e6b6154b02472cb47a.jpg><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;easier to&nbsp;be&nbsp;in&nbsp;denial and blame themselves because then they can try and be&nbsp;the version of&nbsp;themselves that people will accept. After all, their mothers would have told them again and again that they were a&nbsp;disappointment. They would think that if&nbsp;their own mothers treat them badly, surely others cannot be&nbsp;blamed for doing the same thing. It&nbsp;must be&nbsp;all their fault.</p><p><h2>14. They’re unable to&nbsp;let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;toxic relationships.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b19/669/1242465e9897a946a8b978a38c.jpg><p>These girls would find it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;let go&nbsp;of&nbsp;anyone, no&nbsp;matter how bad their relationship is&nbsp;with them. They believe that they can fix the relationship, if&nbsp;they only tried hard enough. This is&nbsp;why they keep going back to&nbsp;the people who hurt them, even though it&nbsp;might have been better to&nbsp;walk away.</p><p><h2>15. They believe that love is&nbsp;a&nbsp;transaction.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9c5/fe3/61137f5afaac4b251f820f721f.jpg><p>To&nbsp;these daughters, love is&nbsp;conditional. Their mother’s treatment taught them that love has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;earned and that it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;taken away. They would always try to&nbsp;bargain and appeal to&nbsp;someone they love, just to&nbsp;feel loved.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you know anyone who suffers these hardships? What other difficulties do&nbsp;you think unloved daughters can have as&nbsp;adults?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52ecOinZ%2Bhk6q5tbXErGStoJGpeqWt1KCfrZ2iqHqwsoyupaWnpp67qHnMqKuhnaKoeqStzWafmq6VYsSpsc1mq6GdqWK0s7vWZqypZWdugXWAk2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
