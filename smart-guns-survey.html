New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>signed legislation into law in 2019</a> that established a commission to set performance standards and approve smart guns, and eventually require gun retailers to sell them but not have to phase out the sales of traditional handguns.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Glaser said he is opposed to any regulation of smart guns, although he signaled an openness to a rebate program that would give consumers some of their money back if they bought a smart gun rather than a regular firearm, similar to incentives that have been used to get people to buy electric vehicles over gas-powered cars.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“I think that as soon as you start trying to regulate or mandate or anything, you risk a tremendous amount of resistance from the American public,” he said. “This should be a market choice.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">So far, there has been no other movement toward regulating or encouraging smart guns, unlike a bicameral bill<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#> reintroduced last year</a> that would have banned the online distribution of 3D-printed gun blueprints. Spokespeople for the lawmakers behind that legislation — Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) and Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) — did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The NRA’s Dalseide said the organization “opposes any regulations that mandate the sale and the use of smart guns.”</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Glaser said LodeStar Works would submit its smart guns for testing to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, as well as any state-level regulators, before they can be bought by the public. ATF spokesman Erik Longnecker said in an email that<a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#> evaluation and classification</a> by the ATF’s Firearms and Ammunition Technology Division is voluntary, but did not comment on smart guns’ future.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Glaser said the time is right for firearms to be more technologically driven, especially given that little has changed in them for a long time. He said gun manufacturers’ inability to combine both mechanical and electrical engineering is one factor that has hindered them.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">“For us, it's somewhat of a mission that we think that the industry is so ripe for innovation,” he said. “It's one of the few industries out there that is not innovating in that way. I keep saying there's more technology in my coffee pot than there is in my firearm.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZMGzsc2dZKydpKmys7%2BOrKSaqqRitLa60maqrqqmmsY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
