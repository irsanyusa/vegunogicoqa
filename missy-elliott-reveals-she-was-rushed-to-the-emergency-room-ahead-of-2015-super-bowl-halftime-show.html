The rapper particularly recalled feeling overwhelmed ahead of her Super Bowl number with the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Firework” singer</a>.</p><p>“I didn’t know how huge, how many people watched the Super Bowl. When I did it, I ended up in the emergency room,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “My anxiety kicked in. Because it was a secret and then, the day before, people started whispering, ‘I think Missy is coming out [during] Katy Perry’s set.’ I started freaking out.”</p><p>She went on and stated that during the “wee hours of the morning before the Super Bowl,” she was in the emergency room. Now, she’s grateful that more people are getting braver in opening up about their mental health.</p><p>“It feels good to be in a time now where you can talk about it,” she said. “Because you realize there’s a lot of people that suffer from anxiety.”</p><a title=@katyperrytv href=# rel=noopener>@katyperrytv</a> -@Missy Elliott is legend-🎙<a title=superbowl href=# rel=noopener>#SuperBowl</a> <a title=tiktok href=# rel=noopener>#tiktok</a> <a title=fypシ href=# rel=noopener>#fypシ</a> <a title="♬ sonido original - Katy Perry TV" href=# rel=noopener>♬ sonido original – Katy Perry TV</a><p>Amusingly, Elliott became the breakout star of that year’s halftime show. After that, Billboard estimated that sales of the rapper’s catalog increased 1,000 percent in one day. “Get Ur Freak On” and “Lose Control” even made it into the iTunes Top 10. Indeed, instances like that even more prove that Elliott is a distinct breed of legend.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-s-the-first-female-rapper-inducted-into-rock-amp-roll-hall-of-fame>She’s the First Female Rapper Inducted Into Rock & Roll Hall of Fame</h2><p>On November 3, Elliott will officially be the first female rap artist to be inducted into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</a> Of always wanting to be a superstar, Elliott stated that she’s “never wavered” and “never changed.”</p><p>According to the rapper, “words cannot describe” how honored she is to take the stage alongside fellow 2023 inductees. For the event, she will be gracing the stage with Kate Bush, Sheryl Crow, George Michael, Willie Nelson, Rage Against the Machine and The Spinners.</p><p>As an artist from the hip-hop world, Elliot believed that Rock Hall is “so far out of reach.” Now that it’s right in her doorstep, the accolade is still unfathomable.</p><p>Elliot’s induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame coincides with the 50th anniversary of the birth of hip-hop. For the rapper, her award is proof that “no matter what people say the hip-hop world is something special and unique.” Elliott will be inducted by her friend of 20 years, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Queen Latifah</a>.</p><p>“She’s somebody that, like I said, ‘come before me, open that door, left it open,'” she said. “And I owe so many flowers, bouquets. It’s not enough bouquets for those women that came before me. And she’s one of those women.”</p><p>Elliott’s mother will also be in the house at the 38th annual induction ceremony on Friday night at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_PutriAriani_Steve-Granitz_FilmMagic-220x147.jpg alt="‘AGT’ Finalist Putri Ariani Releases New Original Song ‘Perfect Liar’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>katy perry</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Missy Elliott</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zKKqrLFdmrmttc6tq2aqlauyorjSZqqhnV2srrR50a6qoZ2UYsGwedOhnGadnZq%2FqLHNnLBmqp%2Bkum6tx56YnWWfm3pzfJBuZKytoJq%2Fbq7OsKNmoJGhs7W1zJ5krKCfrHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
