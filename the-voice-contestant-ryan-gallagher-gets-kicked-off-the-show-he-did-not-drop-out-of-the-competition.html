When it was time for Carson Daly to announce the winner of the Four-Way Knockout based on America’s votes, there were only three artists up on the stage. Carson announced that opera singer Ryan Gallagher had dropped out of the competition. However, Ryan took to social media to say that he did not drop out. What really happened?</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-gallagher-was-kicked-off-the-voice-and-did-not-drop-out>Ryan Gallagher Was Kicked Off ‘The Voice’ And Did Not Drop Out</h2><p>Larriah Jackson, Taryn Papa and Julia Cooper all stood on stage as Carson said “As a side note, Team Kelly’s Ryan Gallagher had to exit the competition.” He then announced that Taryn Papa was the winner of the Four-Way Knockout. Taryn was shocked beyond belief, and later delivered a performance of “I Hope You’re Happy Now”&nbsp;which the coaches praised for being done on such short notice.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>HERE’S WHY ‘THE VOICE’S RYAN GALLAGHER LOOKS SO FAMILIAR</a></strong></p><p>Ryan’s exit from the competition definitely happened abruptly. The way that Carson phrased it made it seem like Ryan dropped out but Ryan had a different explanation for his disappearance from the Live Playoffs. Many assumed it was a family matter since he announced during the Battles that his mother had contracted COVID, but that was not the case. “Thank you everybody for your concern for my family,” Ryan said in an Instagram video. “However, everybody’s fine. That’s not the cause of what happened tonight on&nbsp;The Voice. I didn’t drop out of the show. Details are still to come. I’ll keep you posted.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">According to Entertainment Tonight</a>, Ryan broke&nbsp;The Voice’s&nbsp;strict COVID protocols. Thus, he was kicked off the show due to the concern of keeping the rest of the cast, crew and contestants safe. A source also told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yahoo Entertainment</a>&nbsp;that The Voice “has strict COVID protocols in place to secure a safe set” and Ryan broke them. Ryan has not addressed these claims yet.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-did-not-expect-to-get-kicked-off-the-show>Ryan Did Not Expect To Get Kicked Off The Show</h3><p>Just hours before the show started, Ryan called upon fans to help him decide on an outfit to wear. He also tagged The Voice and Kelly Clarkson in the photoset. At this point, he was still on the show and had no inclination that he was about to get kicked off. All week he was posting stories about how he was in the top 20 as well as acknowledging the love and support of his fans.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CIM65wdla4o/</p></figure><p>A few hours later, he posted the results of his negative COVID test on his Instagram story. This was followed by a video of him drinking out of a mug and mentioning that he was social distancing in Los Angeles. This definitely could have been a dig at the producers of The Voice after they kicked him off the show for breaking safety protocols. This quick decision by the producers could also be the reason why Taryn was surprised that she won the Four-Way Knockout and had such little preparation time.</p><p>Ryan also postponed his Instagram Live session that he was planning on having. He posted one more Instagram story with a caption that said “2020 you are an interesting one.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>‘THE VOICE’S RYAN GALLAGHER OPENS UP ABOUT HIS MOM BEING HOSPITALIZED WITH COVID</a></strong></p><p>With Ryan out of the running, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">17 artists remain</a> on The Voice.
