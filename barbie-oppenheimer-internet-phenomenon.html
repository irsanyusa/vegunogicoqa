Gerwig and Robbie joined in, buying tickets to <i>Oppenheimer</i>, as well as the new <i>Mission Impossible </i>and <i>Indiana Jones</i> movies. Both Nolan and leading-man Cillian Murphy of <i>Oppenheimer</i> have addressed the frenzy, with Nolan telling <a href=# rel=noopener>IGN</a>, “I think for those of us who care about movies, we’ve been really waiting to have a crowded marketplace again, and now it’s here and that’s terrific.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Planning the ideal Barbenheimer day</h2><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maria Carrillo, 22, will take part in Barbenheimer with her friends because it will be a theatrical release unlike any other since COVID-19 began in 2020, as movie-going is only now beginning to get back to <a href=# rel=noopener>pre-pandemic levels</a>. “I’ve always loved going to the movies and this is going to be fun,” she tells TIME.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Carrillo and countless others online are excited about making the collaboration happen, creating special merchandise and self-made <a href=# rel=noopener>trailers</a> and giving <a href=# rel=noopener>advice</a> on how to affordably watching both films in theaters or craft the perfect Barbenheimer viewing itinerary (which can include everything from <a href=# rel=noopener>mimosas</a> to <a href=# rel=noopener>showers and ice coffees</a> to <a href=# rel=noopener>whiskey at Japanese listening bar and an outfit change</a>).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Businesses have gotten in on it—a Barnes & Nobles in Olympia, Washington posted a TikTok with over 30,000 likes of a “Barbeinheimer Starter Pack.” According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Elizabeth Frank</a>, AMC’s CCO and executive VP of worldwide programming, over 20,000 tickets have been sold so far at AMC Theaters to see <i>Barbie</i> and <i>Oppenheimer</i> on the same day.</p><a title=@justmejas href=#>@justmejas</a><p>plus who doesnt love a lil air conditioned movie date in the summer?! @amctheatres should sponsor me at this point🎬🍿 barbiethemovie oppenheimer barbenheimer missionimpossible amcalist movietok nyclife hauntedmansionmovie</p><a title="♬ in nicole kidman we trust - Jas" href=#>♬ in nicole kidman we trust - Jas</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One debate will continue until July 21: in what order should viewers see the movies? One <a href=# rel=noopener>TikToker</a> says she will not be starting with <i>Barbie</i>. “I’m sorry do you also eat dessert first? Oppenheimer first, then <i>Barbie</i> it’s science,” she captioned her video. Others disagree: “People seeing <i>Barbie</i> first are wild,” one person tweeted, offering their preferred schedule.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>people seeing barbie first are wild. the schedule needs to be<br>black coffee and a cigarette<br>oppenheimer around 11 (its 3 hours)<br>mimosas and brunch<br>barbie around 6/7<br>dinner, drinks, club <a href=#>https://t.co/oRxWJmE2xm</a></p>— trish (@ULTRAGLOSS) <a href=#>June 26, 2023</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Carrillo plans to watch Oppenheimer first on July 21. “It makes more sense because it’s a really heavy movie,” she says. Following Oppenheimer, Carrillo and her friends will change outfits and have a debrief dinner before ending “the night with Barbie as a treat, which will be beautiful and pink.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She anticipates both films will live up to their expectations. For now, she’s enjoying the once-in-a-lifetime blockbuster scenario and everything it has brought. “It’s all part of the fun.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamlohXWAjpuYq5qZmnqwvM%2BepaGdmaKys3nIp6ueqp6awW68x56lqKWVo7yvew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
