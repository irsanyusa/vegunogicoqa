There’s no shortage of options, and your perfect pair largely depends on your body shape, height, personal style preferences, and budget, of course. The same pair of jeans your BFF loves and looks killer in may fit awkwardly on you. The best jeans for women should be comfortable, without digging into your waist or giving you the dreaded denim camel toe. They should also fit properly in the butt, thighs, and calves, hit at the right length, and just generally make you feel fabulous. Whether you’re on the hunt for the best baggy denim that’s on trend or want a great, go-to pair of high-waisted skinny jeans to elongate your legs, we’ve rounded up our favorites for every body, budget, and style.</p><h2 id=how-to-choose-the-best-jeans-for-women->How to choose the best jeans for women</h2><p>The perfect pair of denim does exist. You just have to know how to find it. We spoke to celebrity fashion stylist <a rel=nofollow href=#>Kim Appelt</a>, author of <a rel=nofollow href=#>Style for EveryBODY</a>, to get the lowdown on finding those fit-like-a-glove dream jeans you’ll never want to take off.</p><h3>Body type</h3><p>“This is perhaps the single most important factor to consider when looking for jeans,” Appelt says. “The ideal jeans accentuate your personal silhouette and body type. Flattering styles exist for every body, from the sleek and statuesque to the curvaceous and petite.” Take note of the styles, cuts, washes and rises you gravitate toward and what’s already in your closet that you love. This will help narrow down what looks and feels best on your body.</p><h3>Fabric and stretch</h3><p>According to Appelt, fabric is the second most important factor to look at when picking the best jeans for women. “Be thoughtful looking for the perfect blend of comfort and structure, with a hint of stretch.”</p><h3>Style</h3><p>“Personal style knows no bounds, with options ranging from classic straight legs to the trendiest flares, wide legs, and skinnies.” Appelt suggests selecting a style that mirrors your personal aesthetic and looks best on your body shape.</p><h3>Rise</h3><p>Low-rise jeans may be back in fashion, but while it’s fun to try trends, Appelt recommends picking a rise (high, mid or low) that you feel most comfortable in and that flatters your shape. Try on jeans in different rises to discover what works for you.</p><h3>Color and wash</h3><p>In general, darker denim tends to be more slimming and can look dressier for going out—or as a great alternative to <a rel=alternate href=#>dress pants</a> for the office. Lighter, distressed washes are a bit more relaxed and lean more casual. It all depends on the vibe you’re after—and where you’re headed. Note: Darker dyes tends to transfer, so you may want to give your jeans a few washes before wearing with your favorite white sneakers or accessorizing with a designer handbag.</p><h3>Budget</h3><p>Less is more when it comes to the quantity, not the quality of your jeans. “Your budget and intention matter,” says Appelt. “It's important to understand that investing in quality denim is a wise decision, as premium jeans endure and age gracefully.”</p><h3>Brand and fit</h3><p>“Different brands have distinct fits and sizing,” notes Appelt. “Exploration and experimentation are part of the journey to uncover your favored label. Do some research before you head to the store on the different fits then take your time trying as many brands on that you can so you have a better understanding of what works for you.” Also, knowing <a rel=alternate href=#>how to measure your waist for pants</a> properly can help you navigate each brand’s size charts, which may differ quite a bit.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-jeans-for-women>Our top picks for the best jeans for women</h2><h3>Best jeans for curvy women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Good American Always Fits Good Classic Slim Bootcut Jeans</a></h3><p>Co-founded by Khloe Kardashian, Good American, an ultra-popular body-positivity denim brand, caters to curvy women, and these Always Fits Classic Slim Bootcut Jeans live up to the hype, with over a hundred rave reviews. They hug your curves in all the right places and feature an innovative one-size-fits-four stretch design so even when your weight fluctuates or your body goes through changes, they still fit like a glove. They’re also incredibly comfortable, perhaps most important. “They hold your waist in and smooth the tummy, they make your legs go on forever and they lift your butt up,” writes one reviewer. (Basically, it’s almost like wearing <a rel=alternate href=#>shapewear</a>.) Another says, “These jeans never lose their shape, they hold me in in all the right places, and make me feel like a sexy bombshell!”</p><p>Looking for more options? read more about <a rel=alternate href=#>best jeans for curvy women</a>>></p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 00-4 through 28-32 plus</li><li>Style: Bootcut</li><li>Rise: Ultra high</li><li>Inseam length: 33”</li><li>Material: 81.5% Cotton, 5% Recycled Cotton, 4.5% Elasterel-P, 5% Recycled Polyester, 4% Elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $165</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Comfortable</li><li>Designed to always fit, whether you go up or down a size or two</li><li>Extended size range</li><li>High quality</li><li>Figure flattering</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Run long so you may need to get them hemmed</li><li>Slightly pricey</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These stretchy jeans are made to accentuate your curves, and true to their name, will always fit great without losing their shape while flattering yours.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best jeans for curvy women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>ALWAYS FITS GOOD CLASSIC SLIM BOOTCUT JEANS | INDIGO446</h3></p><h3>Best jeans for petite women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Good American Good Petite Skinny Jeans</a></h3><p>“Good American is great for petites and has a really good fit and size run,” says NYC-based Celebrity and Fashion Stylist <a rel=nofollow href=#>Brendan Cannon</a>. These body-hugging and booty-shaping skinny jeans from their petite line have racked up more than 200 positive reviews and are specifically designed for women under 5’4”. They’re available in sizes 00-26 plus and come in a dark blue or black wash that can easily be dressed up or down.</p><p>“Best pair of petite jeans I’ve ever owned,” writes one reviewer.

A super-high rise cinches your true waist and accentuates already long legs for a super cute, cropped look that’s right on trend. They’re made of thick, premium organic cotton with a slight stretch so they’re comfortable but still structured and hold their shape. “As a tall gal, I love this jean and the length option,” says one reviewer. “Denim feels super quality but is also comfortable and has some give. It also feels so soft. 10/10.” Another reviewer writes, “I’m 5’11 and I’ve always struggled to find good length jeans. The tall size isn’t too long! It hits just above my ankles. I’m a true 27 and these fit so perfectly, even sitting down.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 23-35</li><li>Style: Straight leg</li><li>Rise: High</li><li>Inseam length: 29.5” (long), 27.5” (regular), 25.5” inches (short)</li><li>Material: 96% organic cotton, 1% Elastane, 3% other fiber</li><li>Price on publish: $118</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Comes in three inseam lengths</li><li>Lots of color options</li><li>Premium organic cotton</li><li>Great value</li><li>Extended sizes</li><li>Comfortable but structured</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Some reviewers complain of inconsistent sizing, so you may want to order a couple sizes to try</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>Available in a 29.5” inseam length, these ultra high-rise organic jeans are rigid with a slight stretch and hit at the ankle on tall women for a cute, cropped look.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best jeans for tall women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Women's Way-High® Jean by Everlane in Coal, Size 24</h3></p><h3>Best skinny jeans for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Paige Hoxton High Rise Cropped Raw Hem Skinny Jeans</a></h3><p>For skinny jeans, “Paige denim is always a great fit,” says Cannon. We especially love the cool raw hem, light wash and lightweight feel of these high-rise skinnies. They feel fresh for fall paired with a casual sweater and <a rel=alternate href=#>Chelsea boots</a> for day, or a black bodysuit, belt, pea coat, and ankle booties for a night out. Because the material is so light, they transition into the warmer months styled with a crop top and sneakers. “Fantastic fit, they have some stretch but totally not enough to sacrifice the look and feel. I felt sexy in these jeans,” raves one reviewer. Another writes, “Every time I wear these someone asks…did you lose weight? Um what else can I say?”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 24-32</li><li>Style: Skinny</li><li>Rise: High</li><li>Inseam length: 26 inches</li><li>Material: Cotton/polyester/elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $225</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Slimming</li><li>Lightweight</li><li>Versatile wash</li><li>Flattering</li><li>Effortlessly cool raw hem</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Only one color option</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These premium skinny jeans are lightweight, made to flatter, and in a versatile wash you’ll wear constantly.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best skinny jeans for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Paige Hoxton High Rise Cropped Raw Hem Skinny Jeans in Atterberry</h3></p><h3>Best baggy jeans for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Levi’s Baggy Dad Women’s Jeans</a></h3><p>The comfort of <a rel=alternate href=#>leggings </a>and <a rel=alternate href=#>sweatpants </a>with all the swag of your favorite denim. “There isn't any denim brand more classic than Levi’s, and its Baggy Dad jeans are constantly sold out and restocked,” says TV Personality & Lifestyle Expert <a rel=nofollow href=#>Karen J. Firsel</a>. “They have a 10-inch+ front rise with a classic oversized look.” These top-rated jeans hit just below the belly button with a looser fit through the hips and thighs and look killer styled with a fitted crop top, sunglasses and <a rel=alternate href=#>running shoes</a> for an effortlessly cool ‘90s-inspired vibe. Firsel only recommends them for women who are 5’4 and taller though, “because otherwise these jeans will swallow you up.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 23-34</li><li>Style: Baggy, straight-leg</li><li>Rise: Mid</li><li>Inseam length: 28-34 inches (depending on the wash)</li><li>Material: 79% cotton, 21% Tencel Lyocell</li><li>Price on publish: $108</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Lots of wash options</li><li>Multiple inseam lengths for the perfect fit</li><li>Super comfortable</li><li>On trend</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These classic Baggy Dad Jeans from Levi’s are comfortable and cool with all the ‘90s appeal.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best baggy jeans for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Levi's Baggy Dad Women's Jeans 32x32</h3></p><h3>Best wide-leg jeans for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>DU/ER Midweight Denim Wide Leg</a></h3><p>I own these wide-leg DU/ER jeans, and they’re a dream to wear. The retro-inspired silhouette is a fun addition to any closet, and the way they highlight your behind and waist, while elongating the legs, is flattering on so many body shapes. They have a nice weight to them with a bit of stretch for comfort. I especially love the built-in DIY hem bar tacks too, giving you the option to customize the inseam length for a shorter fit should you need. “I love these jeans so much,” says one reviewer. “I'll admit I wasn't sure I liked the idea of ripping off the bottoms to match my height, but the frayed look works so well with the wash of the material. They get 10/10 for comfort, flexibility, and machine washing. I've been a DU/ER fan for years, but this style is something else!” Another notes, “These are great with heels or flats. Not too wide leg, and offer a nice snug fit around the bum and wider around the knees.”</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 24-34</li><li>Style: Wide leg</li><li>Rise: High</li><li>Inseam length: 33 inches</li><li>Material: 70% Cotton, 28% Polyester, 2% LYCRA Spandex</li><li>Price on publish: $139</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Retro wide leg</li><li>DIY hem bar tacks for customized inseam length</li><li>Nice size range</li><li>Comfortable and flattering</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>They are quite long so those under 5’5” will likely need to shorten the inseam</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>If you’re searching for a great go-to pair of wide leg denim, these retro-inspired jeans from DUER are right on trend.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best wide-leg jeans for women</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/shopduer.com/cdn/shop/files/WFMS5332-Midweight-Performance-Denim-Wide-Leg-Vintage-Blue_2157.jpg alt="DU/ER Midweight Denim Wide Leg" title="DU/ER Midweight Denim Wide Leg" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>DU/ER Midweight Denim Wide Leg</h3></p><h3>Best straight-leg jeans for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>MOTHER The Dazzler Mid-Rise Ankle Straight-Leg Jeans</a></h3><p>According to Firsel, these straight-leg MOTHER jeans have a cult following. “They’re a great color with good stretch and flattering on many body shapes,” she says. Many reviewers rave about how buttery soft they are and super flattering on the derriere thanks to well-placed pockets. Like all MOTHER jeans, the premium quality is unmatched and they’re sure to be a staple in your closet for years to come. They’re also a great alternative to skinny jeans if you’re trying to branch out while still staying in your comfort zone. “I own 20+ pairs of Mother jeans and this is my new favorite,” writes one reviewer. Another adds, “Second pair of MOTHER denim and again I am surprised by the quality and luxurious feeling every time I slip into them. They are true to size and hit below my ankle (5’4”). I love the wash of the jeans and fading through the thighs,” she says.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 23-32</li><li>Style: Straight-leg</li><li>Rise: Mid</li><li>Inseam length: 27.5”</li><li>Material: 94% cotton, 5% polyester, 1% elastane</li><li>Price on publish: $248</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Superior quality</li><li>Buttery soft</li><li>Good stretch</li><li>Ultra flattering</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Only one color option</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These cult-fave straight-leg jeans from MOTHER are absolutely worth the splurge, thanks to a super flattering fit and buttery-soft feel.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best straight-leg jeans for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>MOTHER The Dazzler Mid Rise Ankle Straight Leg Jeans in Wish On A Star at Nordstrom, Size 29</h3></p><h3>Best designer jeans for women: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Moussy Vintage Avenal Mid-Rise Straight Tapered Jeans</a></h3><p>Firsel’s favorite designer denim brand is Moussy Vintage, a more structured, no-stretch Japanese denim line with a cult following in Asia. “These run very small but the denim is amazing,” she tells us. “The higher price point makes them a big investment you should wear 24/7.” And trust us, you’ll want to. The medium wash is gorgeous on the Avenal, and the distressing is tastefully done, making them easier to dress up or down. Size up for a more comfortable fit, as the denim is definitely more rigid. The premium quality, cut and fit of these coveted straight-leg jeans is hard to beat.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Size range: 24-32</li><li>Style: Straight leg</li><li>Rise: Mid</li><li>Inseam length: 27.2 inches</li><li>Material: Cotton/spandex</li><li>Price on publish: $360</li></ul><h4>What we like:</h4><ul><li>Expert craftsmanship</li><li>Artful distressing</li><li>Premium cut and quality</li><li>Durable</li></ul><h4>What we don’t like:</h4><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>These cult-fave jeans are the epitome of cool, with a premium cut, quality, and fit that you won’t find for less.</p><p><span class=best-for>Best designer jeans for women</span></p><p><h3 class=title>MOUSSY Avenal High Waist Chew Hem Tapered Leg Jeans in Blue at Nordstrom, Size 28</h3></p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-jeans-for-women->How we selected the best jeans for women</h2><p>We asked real women, pored through hundreds of customer reviews and I used my own personal experience as a writer with a background in fashion. We spoke with celebrity stylists, shopping experts, and fashion influencers to see which denim brands live up to the hype and are worth investing in. We only included top-rated styles with a majority of five- and four-star reviews.</p><h2 id=how-do-i-choose-the-right-jeans-for-my-body-shape>How do I choose the right jeans for my body shape?</h2><p>Cannon suggests starting with what you love about the favorite jeans you own right now. “What style, color, wash, and fit do you like best? Then research on which brands have the things you like best about denim.” He also advises going to a big department store like Bloomingdales, which carries a wide variety of brands, so you can try different brands, sizes and styles all at once. “Ask the sales team to tell you their customer favorites and which brand and fit may be best for your body.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What jeans should I wear if I have a belly?</h3><p>If you're looking to flatter your midsection, Appelt advises opting for high-rise jeans with some stretch. “These jeans provide support and create a smooth silhouette. Dark washes are excellent for a slimming effect and you may want to consider styles with a wider waistband or tummy control panels for added comfort,” she says.</p><h3>Should you go by waist or hips for jeans?</h3><p>“When choosing jeans, it's generally advisable to consider both your waist and hips measurements,” says Appelt. “The best fit often aligns with your larger measurement, whether it's the waist or hips. Some jeans may fit more comfortably around your waist, while others accommodate your hip measurement. Ultimately, the perfect fit is a balance between the two, ensuring comfort and style.”</p><h3>How can you make jeans look classy?</h3><p>Jen Reed, influencer, shopping expert and founder of <a rel=nofollow href=#>@TheSisterStudioIG</a>, recommends taking a pair of non-distressed, medium-wash denim and pairing them with a crisp, polished white button down shirt. “Add a slingback heel, a loafer or even a boot, and add your favorite jewelry for a look that's classy, chic, and works for any occasion,” she advises. “Throw a blazer over your shoulders for an extra-polished look.”</p><h3>How do I know which rise works best for me?</h3><p>According to Cannon, “it’s all about how the jean makes you feel. The mirror is your best friend.”</p><p>He tells his clients to have a second mirror at home to pull out and see what you look like from behind. Appelt adds that short-waisted women will generally pull off a lower rise, while those with long torsos can rock a high rise.</p><h3>How can I tell if I’m wearing the right jeans size?</h3><p>“If your jeans feel too tight, they’ll look too tight,” says Cannon. “And if you feel uncomfortable, you’ll look uncomfortable.” The best jeans for women should fit comfortably and be easy to wear, walk and sit down in. Once you find a style you love, he recommends stocking up in different colors and maybe buying a backup.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lmpqur7%2BMn6arZaekuqa6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
