After the Supreme Court ruled that the travel ban could not be used against anyone from the six Muslim-majority countries who has a “bona fide relationship” with the U.S., the Trump Administration moved quickly to define that term narrowly.

Starting last week, many people began sharing photos of their grandmothers using #BannedGrandmas and #GrandparentsNotTerrorists.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/elham-khatami.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One of the people who curates the account’s photos is Holly Dagres, a 31-year-old analyst based in Jerusalem who stars in the account’s first post. She believes the snapshots put a universal face on the ban’s impact.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Let’s be real. Whose grandmother has ever committed a terrorist attack?” she said. Dagres married her husband in July 2016 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and says family visits were tough before but feels they’re nearly impossible now. “My family cannot come visit me to meet my new husband.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/holly-dagres-mahin-rahmanian.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Elham Khatami, a 30-year-old Washington D.C. outreach director for the National Iranian American Council says she also used the hashtag to put the focus on loved ones. Her Iran-based uncle and his family tried to make it to her May wedding ceremony this year, but the ban stalled the process for so long that by the time they got their visas, it was too late.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I feel tired of being cast aside and of being forced to prove my humanity at every turn,” she said, adding she hasn’t seen her family in a decade. “We don’t recognize this country anymore, and it’s a terrifying feeling.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Kia Hamadanchy, a 31-year-old Irvine, California, Democrat running for Congress in Orange County said he sees the ban as destroying America’s image as a “shining beacon of hope for everyone,” but that there’s power in granny pictures.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I think it helps show who we actually are,” he said. “Donald Trump can go out there with his rhetoric, but everyone loves their grandmother and this shows who he’s actually keeping out.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/kia.jpeg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s Iranians who the ban could potentially affect the most. In 2015, the most<a href=# rel=noopener> recently available data</a>, nearly 26,000 Iranians entered the United States on visitor or tourist visas. But the Instagram account’s team doesn’t want to limit the photos to Iran. Next up: grandma photos from Yemen, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Libya too.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZtcGRqhXV9jq2pmq6VoXqjrc1mmZqmnpqxbrPRmqWdpZGoerS7wqKYpWWdmrGqrY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
