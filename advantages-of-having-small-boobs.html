Before you take that thought further, you should know there are some advantages of having smaller boobs that you probably didn't know.</p><p><h2 class="heading-h2 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-4>5 advantages of having small boobs</h2></p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Here are five advantages of having small boobs;</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>1. No back pain caused by big boobs</h3></p><p>One major issue ladies with big breasts suffer from is breast-induced back pain. Research even says the larger your breasts, the higher your chances of having shoulder and neck pain. So while you might be thinking your boobs are too small, your neck and back are thankful for it.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>2. Bras are cheaper and easy to buy</h3></p><p>For ladies who have small boobs, they can testify that their bra sizes are easy to come by and most times even cheaper. You do not enjoy this same luxury as a big boobs girlie.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-10>3. You get more pleasure during sex</h3></p><p>Bigger boobs might look more attractive to some, but when it comes to feeling pleasure, small boobs have a big advantage in bed. This is backed by research from the University of Vienna that noted that small boobs are 24% more sensitive than their larger counterparts and are therefore easier to stimulate during foreplay.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-12>4. You can go out without wearing a bra</h3></p><p>Another advantage of having small boobs is that you can always go braless. Do you see the inconvenience that comes with wearing bras? You can avoid it and no one would even notice if you have small boobs. This is even a healthier option as research suggests that wearing bras can prevent the growth of breast tissue.</p><p>In addition to this, smaller boobs offer you the advantage of a broader range of options of clothes from deep V-necks and backless dresses to strapless tops and form-fitting blouses, which big boobs girlies have to think twice before wearing.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-d4f1de28-509a-4e4d-954f-f5e9b7a0beb0 data-caption="You should appreciate yourself more [Top for Days]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/UbpktkpTURBXy9hMjViODVlNjA5Y2FlNDQ1MmFjYWRhMGE5ODk4YWNmMi5qcGeRlQLNAcTNAX7Cww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-16>5. You can sleep on your stomach.</h3></p><p>Perhaps the sweetest of them all. With smaller boobs, you can sleep on your stomach without much discomfort. Not so much if you are on the big side when it comes to boobs.</p><p>In conclusion, the advantages of having small breasts are way more than the above and if you are a small-boob girl, you should appreciate yourself more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK6lwsCnq5qflah6sLKMoZivoZ6cerS5wKWjZpqfpK%2B0e8accHJwnaM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
