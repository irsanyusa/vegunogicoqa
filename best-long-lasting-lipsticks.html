Depending on the shade and finish, lipstick can brighten up your face, add color to a neutral clothing palette or make a bold statement. But this can all be undermined if your makeup wears off soon after you’ve put it on. On top of that, it can fade unevenly for a messy, undesirable effect.</p><p>Long-lasting lipstick is designed to overcome the usual wear-and-tear of lip makeup. Historically, these products have compensated for their staying power with drying formulas that can be uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time. Today’s top selections are reliable for hours of wear, while keeping lips hydrated and soft. Available in a range of picture-perfect shades, we’ve compiled this list of our favorite long-lasting lipsticks to help you find the right one for you.</p><h2 id=our-top-picks-for-the-best-long-lasting-lipsticks>Our top picks for the best long-lasting lipsticks</h2><p>The best long-lasting lipsticks should stay in place for hours, even after eating and drinking. Beyond that, they may not appear alike at all! Just like with a regular lipstick, you can choose between shiny, satin, and matte finishes, as well as from nudes to brights. There’s also a winner for every level of budget.</p><h3>Best drugstore long-lasting lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Lip Color</a></h3><p>A household favorite, Maybelline delivers again with its SuperStay Matte Ink Lip Color, a long-lasting lipstick with a matte finish that promises up to 16 hours of wear. This product is available for just over $10 and comes in 30 different shades, including a mix of nudes and bright pinks and reds. The precision applicator ensures the color will go on smoothly and reviewers love that it truly does last for hours without smudging, so much so that you’ll need a proper cleanser to remove it. Because of the matte finish, it can feel a little more drying than other options on this list, but the great price and color range make this a fan favorite for a reason.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 30</li><li>Size: 0.17 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: N/A (<a rel=nofollow href=#>Maybelline</a> notes that they do not test on animals)</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Up to 16 hours of wear</li><li>Very affordable price</li><li>Good color range</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Formula can be drying</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best drugstore</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Maybelline SuperStay Matte Ink Liquid Lipstick - Seductress</h3></p><h3>Best long-lasting matte lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Sephora Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick</a></h3><p>Sephora’s own brand Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick is a community favorite and it’s no surprise why. Don’t be misled, this is definitely lipstick and not a stain. The creamy formula ensures that the product sits smoothly on the mouth, thanks to the addition of avocado oil, while the incredible range of 74 colors means there’s a shade for every occasion. The lipstick boasts a transfer-proof finish, even when eating and drinking, and yet removes easily with cleanser. At just $15, this is a great mid-range option that lives up to its promises.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 74</li><li>Size: 0.169 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: N/A</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>An incredible range of 74 shades</li><li>Includes avocado oil as an ingredient for hydration</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Requires proper cleansing with makeup remover to take off</li><li>Only available at Sephora</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best matte</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s1296060-main-zoom.jpg alt="SEPHORA COLLECTION Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick 01 Always Red 0.169 oz/ 5 mL" title="SEPHORA COLLECTION Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick 01 Always Red 0.169 oz/ 5 mL" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>SEPHORA COLLECTION Cream Lip Stain Liquid Lipstick 01 Always Red 0.169 oz/ 5 mL</h3></p><h3>Best long-lasting red lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Dior Rouge Dior Forever Transfer-Proof Lipstick</a></h3><p>Dior’s Rouge Dior Forever lipsticks come in more shades than just red, but the iconic brand has a particularly strong range of red hues within its collection. Notably, the 999 Forever Dior is named for the first two lipsticks launched by Christian Dior, the #9 and #99. Every lipstick in this formula is infused with red peony extract for maximum hydration, despite the matte finish, and the brand reports over 16 hours of wear and comfort. With its stylish brand packaging and strong pigments, Dior Rouge Forever lipstick makes your everyday makeup routine feel a little bit more luxurious.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 29</li><li>Size: 0.12 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: N/A</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Luxe packaging</li><li>Dior offers some of the best red hues on the market</li><li>Up to 16 hours of wear</li></ul><h4>Con:</h4><ul><li>The luxury price tag</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best red lipstick</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Dior Rouge Dior Forever Transfer-Proof Lipstick - 670 Rose Blues</h3></p><h3>Best glossy long lasting lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>NYX Shine Loud High Shine Lip Color</a></h3><p>If a high-shine finish is more your style, then look no further than the NYX Shine Loud High Shine Lip Color. This lipstick comes in a dual-applicator format that includes a colored lipstick and a shiny gloss top coat. The formula is cruelty-free and vegan, while offering ultra-pigmentation and long-lasting wear in 36 different colors. The range goes beyond the usual nudes, pinks and reds with some greens, blues and purples; at the low price of $12, the NYX lip color is a great choice for trying new looks. The moisturizing high shine top coat keeps lips hydrated, although it is recommended that you let each layer dry fully to avoid a tacky or flaky finish. This lipstick truly is a case of applying it once and forgetting about it all day.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Shiny</li><li>Shades: 36</li><li>Size: 0.22 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: Cruelty-Free and Vegan</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>It’s different from the usual matte finish</li><li>Offers unique colors (like blue, green, and purple) in addition to the usual pinks, reds, and neutral shades</li><li>Affordable price point</li><li>Up to 16 hours of wear</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Takes a little longer to apply thanks to the dual-step application</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best glossy</span></p><p><h3 class=title>NYX Professional Makeup Shine Loud Vegan High Shine Long-Lasting Liquid Lipstick - Stay Stuntin'</h3></p><h3>Best luxury long-lasting lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Armani Beauty Lip Power Satin Long Lasting Lipstick</a></h3><p>A great midpoint between shiny and matte is the classic satin finish, which Armani does so well. Its Armani Beauty Lip Power Satin Long Lasting Lipstick is really the ultimate in luxury lip care, from its slim, elongated bullet packaging to the comprehensive range of elegant colors. Nothing overly bright or brash here, Armani only offers nudes, pinks and reds in every depth imaginable. The silky satin finish leaves a subtle sheen and substantial hydration, along with its staying power. You do have to pay for this quality, with each lipstick coming in at $45, but fans will tell you it’s worth the investment.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Satin</li><li>Shades: 20</li><li>Size: 0.10 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: N/A</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Subtle satin finish</li><li>Good variety of classic shades</li><li>Very hydrating feel</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>The high price and small size</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best luxury</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2469385-main-zoom.jpg alt="Armani Beauty Lip Power Long Lasting Lipstick 108 In Love 0.10 oz/ 3 g" title="Armani Beauty Lip Power Long Lasting Lipstick 108 In Love 0.10 oz/ 3 g" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>Armani Beauty Lip Power Long Lasting Lipstick 108 In Love 0.10 oz/ 3 g</h3></p><h3>Best budget long-lasting lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Wet n Wild Megalast Liquid Catsuit Matte Lipstick</a></h3><p>A long-lasting lipstick that costs the same as your morning latte? It’s real and it’s available at Wet n Wild. The Megalast Liquid Catsuit Matte Lipstick is just over $5 and offers a lightweight formula that will stick with you through coffee, lunch and dinner. Like other matte finishes, this lipstick can feel a little drying over time but the glossy application provides a layer of protection. Those looking for a large variety of shades may want to look elsewhere, as Wet n Wild only offers nine colors in this lipstick, but they cover a lot of ground from pale pink to deep burgundy. Overall, this lipstick way outperforms its price point and is an affordable way to try out a new color trend or the matte style.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 9</li><li>Size: 0.21 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: N/A</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Incredible value</li><li>Truly long-lasting</li><li>Highly pigmented</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Limited color range</li><li>A little drying</li></ul><h3>Best nude long-lasting lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick</a></h3><p>Charlotte Tilbury is the big name for nude long-lasting lipstick, specifically, the Matte Revolution Lipstick in the shade Pillow Talk. Pillow Talk was the number-one lipstick in the UK luxury makeup market in 2020, according to the NPD Group, and it’s easy to see why. The product utilizes 3D glowing pigments that create the illusion of being lit from within, while extracts of orchid and lipstick tree keep lips moisturized and soft. Although nudes aren’t known for being particularly exciting, they can really pull your face together into a finished look and that’s exactly what the Charlotte Tilbury Matte Revolution Lipstick does. With a wear time of up to 10 hours, it’s not the longest-lasting product on this list but it’s the kind of product you’ll want to keep in your purse at all times.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 16</li><li>Size: 0.12 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: N/A</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Unique “‘Lit from within”’ glow finish</li><li>Ultra-moisturizing</li><li>Nude shades are highly flattering</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Shorter wear time than others</li><li>Limited color palette</li><li>High price point</li></ul><h3>Best long-lasting lipstick for beginners: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick</a></h3><p>Liquid lipstick is generally quite uncomplicated to apply, but Anastasia Beverly Hills makes it even easier with a rounded applicator that allows for neat, focused lip painting. The rich pigment only needs one or two coats for full coverage, so there are fewer opportunities for error. The 16-color range sticks to the main classics of pink, nude and red, making these very accessible shades for beginners. Nevertheless, there’s no compromise on performance: The lipsticks last for hours, through drinking and eating, with minimal need for touch ups. At a mid-range price of $20, this is a slightly higher-end product that will hold up reliably.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 16</li><li>Size: 0.11 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: N/A</li></ul><h4>Pro:</h4><ul><li>Easy application</li><li>Very long wear time</li><li>Great pigmentation.</li></ul><h4>Con:</h4><ul><li>Slightly limited color range that focuses on classic shades</li><li>Can be drying</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best for beginners</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Anastasia Beverly Hills Liquid Lipstick - Poet</h3></p><h3>Best splurge long-lasting lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Pat McGrath MatteTrance Lipstick</a></h3><p>The Pat McGrath MatteTrance Lipstick stands out with a bold, golden pout adorning each lipstick bullet. The fun doesn’t stop there, as this formula is made of an oil-infused powder that nourishes lips while creating a soft-focus effect. High pigmentation ensures that you only need one coat for full coverage, which helps maintain a lightweight feeling—ideal for when your lipstick is going to last all day! The lipstick can be applied directly from the bullet, patted on as a stain, or even used on cheeks as a blush, making this a great multi-use product worthy of a splurge. With the wide range of hues available, you can be confident you’ll find exactly the right color for you.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 24</li><li>Size: 0.14 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: N/A</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Fun packaging</li><li>Moisturizing formula and lightweight feeling all day</li><li>Dual purpose as a blush</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Expensive price</li><li>Unique powder formula may not be everyone’s preference</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best splurge</span></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.sephora.com/productimages/sku/s2049369-main-zoom.jpg alt="PAT McGRATH LABS MatteTrance Lipstick Full Blooded 0.14 oz/ 4 g" title="PAT McGRATH LABS MatteTrance Lipstick Full Blooded 0.14 oz/ 4 g" width=256 height=160 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><h3 class=title>PAT McGRATH LABS MatteTrance Lipstick Full Blooded 0.14 oz/ 4 g</h3></p><h3>Long-lasting lipstick with the best shade variety: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Stila Stay All Day Long Wear Liquid Lipstick</a></h3><p>It may not have the greatest number of shades (that would be the Sephora Cream Lip Stain Liquid Liquid with 74 colors), but the Stila Stay All Day Long Wear Liquid Lipstick offers the greatest range of finishes and styles—in a category that is dominated by matte lipsticks. Stila’s 23-shade collection includes a series of shimmer and sheer finishes in different hues, while still maintaining the brand guarantee of 12 hours of wear. A lot of these are more subtle nudes and pinks, which make this lipstick particularly versatile. Vitamin E and avocado oil keep the formula moisturizing and comfortable to wear all day long, while the doe foot applicator is designed to make it easier to outline lips accurately.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finishes: Matte, Sheer, Shimmer</li><li>Shades: 23</li><li>Size: 0.10 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: Yes</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Great versatility in terms of finishes</li><li>Very hydrating</li><li>Useful applicator for precise application</li><li>12 hours of wear</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Color range is mostly nudes, classic pinks, and reds</li><li>Small size</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best shade variety</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Stila Stay All Day Long Wear Liquid Lipstick - Carina Shimmer</h3></p><h3>Long-lasting lipstick with the best pigment: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Fenty Stunna Lip Paint Longwear Fluid Lip Color</a></h3><p>Fenty has been impressing everyone since it joined the makeup market and the brand’s Stunna Lip Paint Longwear Fluid Lip Color is another strong addition to its range. These lipsticks come in a stylish, stiletto-shaped package, and really pack a punch when it comes to pigment. One coat is more than enough in most cases. Although the color range is the most limited on our list at just seven shades, each of these was designed to look good across a variety of skin tones, so they do double duty. The soft matte finish is a fan favorite and although a little more expensive than other choices at $28, the one-coat promise makes this great value.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 6</li><li>Size: 0.13 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: Cruelty-free and Vegan</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Great pigmentation</li><li>Designed for every skin tone</li><li>Fun bottle shape</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Limited to seven colors currently</li><li>The applicator can be a little tricky to use</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>best pigment</span></p><p><h3 class=title>FENTY BEAUTY by Rihanna Stunna Lip Paint Longwear Fluid Lip Color - Underdawg</h3></p><h3>Best Transfer-Proof Long Lasting Lipstick: <a rel=nofollow href=#>Revlon Colorstay Suede Ink</a></h3><p>Even when lipsticks have a long wear time, they can still end up transferring onto other surfaces, staining fabrics or leaving marks on glasses. With the Revlon Colorstay Suede Ink lipstick, wearers can be confident that their pout is transfer-proof yet still ultra pigmented. The lipstick’s built-in primer is responsible for the smoothing effect and strong grip that keeps smiles looking perfect with just one swipe of formula. At under $10 from Walmart, this Revlon choice is a very affordable product that still packs in high quality ingredients like vitamin E to promote nourishment and hydration. The 18 shades are fairly traditional pinks and reds, but there’s one bold purple shade for the more adventurous. Although 8 hours is the lowest guaranteed wear time on this list, this is still a great lipstick to have on hand.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Finish: Matte</li><li>Shades: 18</li><li>Size: 0.09 oz</li><li>Cruelty-Free: Vegan</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Transfer-proof for minimal mess</li><li>Great value at under $10</li><li>Built-in primer for lip smoothing and color grip</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Only 8 hours of guaranteed wear time</li><li>Small size</li></ul><p><span class=best-for>Best Transfer-Proof</span></p><p><h3 class=title>Revlon ColorStay Suede Ink Lightweight Matte Lipstick with Vitamin E 005 Hot Girl</h3></p><h2 id=what-should-you-look-for-when-buying-long-lasting-lipstick>What should you look for when buying long-lasting lipstick?</h2><p>Every pick on this list is a winner, but some will probably be a better fit for you and your needs than others. To determine which lipstick is the right one for you, it can be helpful to consider these key questions:</p><h3>How much do I want to spend?</h3><p>Our selections span from $5.49 to $45, so there really is something for everyone. When deciding how much you want to budget for this purchase, you may want to think about how often you will use the product and therefore what is worth it to you. If you have lots of other lipsticks in your rotation—or if you’re not a regular lipstick wearer in general—you may want to spend less on this individual item. If you know you’re going to use this as a daily or weekly workhorse product, then it may be worth it to upgrade to a slightly more expensive pick.</p><p>We back every choice on this list, but the more expensive options do often come with more hydrating formulas and greater color selection. You also may be paying for more fancy packaging, so consider if that is important to you. Brand loyalists may be willing to pay more to stay with their preferred brand, while others may be more open to trying something new.</p><h3>What finish do I prefer?</h3><p>The majority of options in the long-lasting lipstick space come in a matte finish, which is a fun, modern style that can be dressed up or down. However, you may prefer something more slick and shiny, in which case the NYX Shine Loud High Shine Lip Color may be a better fit. If you’re somewhere in between, a satin finish like Armani Beauty Lip Power Satin Long Lasting Lipstick is a great middle ground. For something more subtle, Stila’s selection of shimmers and sheers are a pretty, but low-key option.</p><h3>Do I often experience dry lips?</h3><p>The one downside of long-lasting lipstick is that hours of coverage can lead to dehydration of the lips, which in turn can make the skin scaly or flaky. While all brands recommend lightly exfoliating and moisturizing lips before lipstick application, some formulas are more hydrating than others. If dry lips are something you are prone to, make sure to look out for ingredients like vitamin E, avocado oil or other oils, or other extracts that tout hydrating properties.</p><h2 id=how-we-chose-the-best-long-lasting-lipsticks>How we chose the best long-lasting lipsticks</h2><p>To ensure every lipstick on this list delivered on expectations, we conducted our own review process and also scoured the internet for the most high-performing products in the market. Lipsticks were worn for at least 8 hours and tested to see if they held up during eating and drinking, then assessed for pigmentation and feel.</p><p>Online, we reviewed a mix of industry expert and customer opinions, to make sure our choices were universally beloved. We took into account price, color range, pigmentation, endurance, feel, application, and packaging to make sure we assessed the full experience.</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What’s the best way to apply long-lasting lipstick?</h3><p>Many of these lipsticks are in liquid form, meaning they’re applied with a separate applicator first dipped into the liquid, then placed on lips. Different brands have different-shaped applicators designed for more precise movement or coverage. The bullet-shaped products can be applied just like any regular lipstick: either directly from the bullet, or tapped onto the lips with a finger or brush.</p><p>For the most long-lasting, smooth effect, it’s recommended to lightly exfoliate and then moisturize the lips before applying any lipstick. This removes any dry skin that may drag or stick to the product and ensures that lips are hydrated before they are sealed under the formula. To help the lipstick stay in place, blot the lips lightly after moisturizing to remove any excess that may encourage sliding or smudging.</p><h3>How can I choose the right lipstick shade for me?</h3><p>When deciding what color will look best on you, you’ll want to take into account your hair color, skin tone, and eye color so you don’t pick a shade that clashes with your natural coloring. Knowing your skin’s undertone (cool, warm, or neutral) will also help guide you when buying <a rel=alternate href=#>eyeshadow palettes</a>, blush, and even <a rel=alternate href=#>tinted moisturizers</a> or <a rel=alternate href=#>tinted sunscreens</a> (which tend to go by undertone rather than a wide range of shades). Skin is cool-toned if there is a blue, pink or red flatter your skin; if you look better in silver than gold jewelry; and if your veins look more blue in color. Correspondingly, cool-toned people look better with cooler-toned nudes and colors with a blue or purple undertone, such as a cherry red rather than a brick red.</p><p>Warm-toned skin will show up as a yellow, gold, or olive hint to skin; with veins that are more green than blue; and as better-suited to gold than silver jewelry. Warm-toned nudes will be a better fit, as well as colors with an orange or red undertone, such as corals, terracotta, brick red etc. Neutral-toned skin is best suited by a range of colors, so it can be best to focus on how light or dark your skin is to find a complementary color—but really anything can work!</p><h3>What’s the best way to remove long-lasting lipstick?</h3><p>A downside of long-lasting lipstick is that it can be a pain to remove, thanks to its staying power. You likely won’t be able to just wipe it off with a tissue, so leverage your skincare and deploy a cleanser for comprehensive removal. Oil-based cleansers are often preferred, as they’re better able to lift the product from the skin and hydrate lips in the process. Try not to rub too hard or pull at the skin, instead use gentle movements, warm water, and sufficient cleanser to take any lipstick off.</p><h3>Which lipstick stays even after eating?</h3><p>Each brand claims a different amount of wear time, from eight hours to 16+ hours, but in general you’re looking at a full eight-hour workday of wear (and most likely longer). This includes eating. Eating and drinking will cause more wear and tear and may reduce the overall wear time, but all of our choices hold up to at least one meal and a few drinks. Keep the product with you, just in case you want to reapply, but rest assured, you’ve got several hours of wear guaranteed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnKS7qHnLmqqtoZ6ceq21z6yropubqHw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
