The thing is, accents from the United Kingdom differ massively depending on where the speaker is from. Sometimes they can even differ from village to village. And, you’ve guessed it, accents in the UK can be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>, Welsh, Northern Irish, or Scottish, but there is no such thing as one British accent.<br><span><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pronunciation</a></span> is one of the hardest things to learn. In this article, we will explain to you how to do a proper British accent!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How to speak in a British accent</h2><p>What people commonly describe as a “British accent” is actually called “received pronunciation”. This term describes “the standard accent of Standard English” and is generally spoken in the south of England. The term was introduced by phonetician Daniel Jones, but it is sometimes replaced by other terminologies such as “BBC Pronunciation”.</p><p>Regardless of the way you call it, you can definitely master this accent. Or if you prefer, any other UK accent! So the question is, how can you talk in a British, or more specifically, an English accent?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Actively listen to the way people speak</h2><p>To start sounding more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">native and have a British accent</a>, your best bet is to watch programmes on the BBC. Try to observe the way their presenters use their mouth, their tongue, and watch the way their lips move. You’ll notice that there are local programmes too, so you could pick up a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">northern</a>, southern or Geordie accent in the process!</p><p>Not only should you pay attention to the sounds that are coming out of their mouth, but you should also focus on trying to figure out&nbsp;how&nbsp;these sounds are coming out. Which parts of their mouth are they using when producing them? Try to imitate the way they speak.</p><p>You could also record yourself saying the same sentences and compare your version to the original one. Don’t worry about sounding silly, we guarantee that this method really helps!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Words that are pronounced differently in the UK and in the US</h2><p>Some words are pronounced in very <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><span>different ways in the UK to the US</span></a>.
