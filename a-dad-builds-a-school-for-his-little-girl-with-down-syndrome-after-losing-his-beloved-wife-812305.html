They met in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2002</a>, and after 2&nbsp;years they tied the knot. The duo worked hard to&nbsp;achieve popularity, focusing on&nbsp;various albums. Among them all, the most recognizable is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Life of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Song</i></a>, for which they won several awards.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/997/a49/549cfe51d4b7666e948dad9c46.jpg><p>As&nbsp;they made the decision to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> together, they demonstrated the same commitment they had to&nbsp;their job. Joey and Rory welcomed their first child, Indiana Feek, in&nbsp;February <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2014</a>. Indiana, who was born in&nbsp;Columbia, Tennessee, was diagnosed with Down syndrome at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age.</p><p>They documented their journey as&nbsp;parents on&nbsp;their blog and in&nbsp;their music, and they quickly became an&nbsp;inspiration to&nbsp;many. Her caring father, Rory <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claims</a> that “<strong>she just needs love</strong>, just like everybody else.” And they truly loved her in&nbsp;the most committed way possible, never making her feel different from anyone else.</p><p>Yet, Indiana is&nbsp;not Rory’s only child&nbsp;— before marrying Joey, the singer had already raised his adult children, Hopie and Heidi, from a&nbsp;previous relationship. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “My&nbsp;experience raising Indiana is&nbsp;no&nbsp;different than raising Heidi and Hopie. And the thing&nbsp;is, she doesn’t suspect that there’s anything different about her. She has no&nbsp;thought in&nbsp;the world.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/081/459/71662a58a794d5f677b03b26a3.jpg><p>Life can be&nbsp;unpredictable, and unexpected events or&nbsp;circumstances can disrupt a&nbsp;family’s equilibrium. And life took a&nbsp;turn for the worse with Rory’s family, when, sadly, Joey was diagnosed with cervical <a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a> in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2014</a>. However, with love, patience, and support, they found new ways to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;normalcy and routine for their child, even in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;that sad diagnosis.</p><p>While Joey was undergoing intense treatment, the couple never stopped loving and raising their child to&nbsp;the best of&nbsp;their abilities. This can be&nbsp;particularly challenging for families who have children with special needs, but Joey and Rory devoted themselves to&nbsp;overwhelming Indiana with all the affection and care she deserved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bae/945/d21afe50808e1087cdb6bdedf0.jpg><h2>Rory <a href=#>channeled</a> his grief into becoming a&nbsp;constant source of&nbsp;joy for Indiana.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfc/fc5/0644f453629e01453a066a97f0.jpg><p>Joey’s battle with the disease ended in&nbsp;2016, and at&nbsp;that time her lovely husband Rory <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>: “My&nbsp;wife’s greatest dream came true today. She is&nbsp;in&nbsp;heaven. The cancer is&nbsp;gone. The pain has ceased, and all her tears are dry.”</p><p>Coping with that big grief hadn’t been easy for him, but through it&nbsp;all, Rory has remained steadfast in&nbsp;his faith, and he&nbsp;has found comfort in&nbsp;the knowledge that Joey is&nbsp;watching over him and their family. Despite the challenges he&nbsp;has faced, Rory remains positive, and his story is&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;the power of&nbsp;love, faith, and the resilience of&nbsp;the human spirit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b8/bce/8ebefa5b24a6075e0437754a3d.jpg><p>After Joey passed away, Rory was determined to&nbsp;give Indiana the best life possible. Throughout his journey as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single father, the singer has remained committed to&nbsp;keeping Joey’s memory alive. He&nbsp;usually takes Indiana to&nbsp;visit her mom’s grave, and he&nbsp;often shares touching stories and memories of&nbsp;his wife with his fans and followers.</p><p>“I&nbsp;feel just as&nbsp;married and just as&nbsp;in&nbsp;love,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a><i>. </i>“I&nbsp;feel like she’s just as&nbsp;much a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;our life as&nbsp;she was.”</p><p>Through his music and his blog, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>This Life I&nbsp;Live</i></a>, Rory has inspired countless people with his message of&nbsp;love, hope, and faith. He&nbsp;has shown that even in&nbsp;the darkest of&nbsp;times, there is&nbsp;always light to&nbsp;be&nbsp;found, and that the love of&nbsp;family can help&nbsp;us overcome any obstacle.</p><h2>Thanks to&nbsp;donations for his wife, Rory built a&nbsp;<a href=#>school</a> for Indiana.</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/50a/69a/ef267b5148989bddfbff8c9af0.jpg><p>Joey had always wished to&nbsp;homeschool their daughter Indiana, and despite her passing, Rory was determined to&nbsp;fulfill her wish. However, when Rory found himself struggling to&nbsp;balance homeschooling and caring for Indiana on&nbsp;his own, he&nbsp;came up&nbsp;with the idea of&nbsp;building a&nbsp;school on&nbsp;their farm</p><p>A&nbsp;parent will go&nbsp;to&nbsp;any length to&nbsp;make their child’s life easier, and that’s exactly what Rory did for Indiana. He&nbsp;wanted Indiana to&nbsp;receive the best education possible, and he&nbsp;knew that a&nbsp;traditional school environment might not be&nbsp;the best fit for her. By&nbsp;building a&nbsp;school on&nbsp;their farm, he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;provide Indiana with a&nbsp;safe and familiar environment where she could learn and grow at&nbsp;her own pace.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/895/0d1/caa0a95b90b13e5205afc94dd0.jpg><p>The school, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Hardison Mill School</a>, is&nbsp;staffed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;team of&nbsp;experienced educators who work closely with Rory to&nbsp;develop a&nbsp;curriculum that meets Indiana’s needs. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also open to&nbsp;other children in&nbsp;the community, giving them the opportunity to&nbsp;learn and grow alongside Indiana.</p><p>“I&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stayed</a> for a&nbsp;long time this morning and watched Indiana play with her new friends on&nbsp;their first day of&nbsp;school. And as&nbsp;I&nbsp;watched, I&nbsp;thought of&nbsp;how blessed we&nbsp;are, and how wonderful it&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;using our blessing to&nbsp;bless others.”</p><p>Rory’s decision to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;school on&nbsp;their farm is&nbsp;a&nbsp;testament to&nbsp;his love and dedication to&nbsp;his daughter, and it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;reflection of&nbsp;his commitment to&nbsp;fulfilling Joey’s wishes, even in&nbsp;her absence. “Indiana’s smile lights up&nbsp;not just the room, but the world,” her father <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>.</p><p><h2>Indiana still remembers her mom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24e/440/1851cc563ca77b83e0b8556748.jpg><p>Even though Indiana was just a&nbsp;baby when Joey passed, her father tells her everything about her mother’s life. Her mother continues to&nbsp;be&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her family’s life, and her memory is&nbsp;very much alive for Indiana.</p><p>One day while having lunch, Joey started singing on&nbsp;the radio, and her daughter immediately recognized her voice: “It’s Mama,” Rory <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> his daughter saying. “Indiana is&nbsp;highly aware of&nbsp;her mama, her mama’s voice, and what her mama looks like. <strong>She keeps her alive, just like I&nbsp;do</strong>.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ab8/3d0/1a232d5ccbb612e23ee39b6328.jpg><p>Through his writing and music, Rory has kept Joey’s memory alive for their fans and for Indiana, who is&nbsp;now a&nbsp;bright and happy 6-year-old girl. “We’ve settled into a&nbsp;really wonderful life. Both of&nbsp;my&nbsp;sisters live on&nbsp;the farm with&nbsp;us,” says Rory. “<strong>Most little girls have a&nbsp;mother. Indiana has a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;mothers</strong>.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;Joey and think, ’How in&nbsp;the world did&nbsp;I get this lucky?’” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a>. “This morning Indy climbed in&nbsp;bed with&nbsp;me.
