But her real-life role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother came to&nbsp;her through the adoption that happened in&nbsp;2010. Sandra Bullock <strong>became the single mother of&nbsp;baby Louis.</strong></p><p><h2>She had many doubts about being a&nbsp;mother and adoption.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/453/aca/b7fc7d5defbbc67f347feb9c80.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one <a href=#>interview</a>, Sandra had a&nbsp;very emotional conversation. She was asked if&nbsp;she had any doubts about being a&nbsp;single mother at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;41. Sandra confessed that <strong>the impact of&nbsp;Hurricane Katrina had convinced her to&nbsp;adopt children</strong>: “I&nbsp;did <a href=#>think</a>, ’Maybe not.’ Then [Hurricane] Katrina happened. I’m going to&nbsp;cry ... Katrina happened in&nbsp;New Orleans and something told&nbsp;me, ’My child is&nbsp;there.’ It&nbsp;was weird.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d79/3f6/28ea3e5054ad75aa5e450dfc33.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was especially difficult to&nbsp;make this decision because she is&nbsp;always in&nbsp;the spotlight and her life is&nbsp;being constantly judged by&nbsp;the public. But even her divorce with Jesse James didn’t stop Sandra from going through with the adoption process: “<a href=#>He</a>&nbsp;fit in&nbsp;the crook of&nbsp;my&nbsp;arm. He&nbsp;looked me&nbsp;in&nbsp;the eyes. He&nbsp;was wise. My&nbsp;child was wise.”</p><p>But during this whole process of&nbsp;searching, finding her baby wasn’t easy and Sandra was questioning whether she’d ever become a&nbsp;mother: “<strong>The perfect <a href=#>child</a> will find you. You will find your child.</strong> But you don’t believe that when it’s not happening. When you’re going, ’Where is&nbsp;my&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>?’”</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was Sandra’s son Louis who convinced her to&nbsp;adopt one more child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b6/79b/3f2e135868b923146ae069b3f1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the same interview, Bullock <a href=#>shared</a> what happened during the exact moment that she started to&nbsp;think about adoption for a&nbsp;second time. During a&nbsp;dinner conversation between Sandra and her girlfriends, who were discussing their daughters, 3-year-old Louis came and said: “Yeah, I&nbsp;don’t have daughters. <strong>But I’m going to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;baby soon.”</strong></p><p>Sandra thinks that Louis already knew something and it&nbsp;was exactly around the time when her future daughter, named Laila, was born.<strong> It&nbsp;was like a&nbsp;puzzle that matched. </strong>Bullock announced in&nbsp;December <a href=#>2015</a> that she had adopted her second child, Laila.</p><p><h2>Sandra Bullock feels that her family is&nbsp;finally complete.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ef3/d8f/c52f65533faaccdc634fc7f6b7.jpg><p>It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;long way to&nbsp;motherhood, but Sandra finally feels complete. She feels that this is&nbsp;what she was made for, but still, there are no&nbsp;other plans to&nbsp;adopt more kids: “No, I&nbsp;<a href=#>think</a> this is&nbsp;it. But everyone keeps saying, <strong>‘Never say never,’ </strong>so&nbsp;I’ll say, ‘No, I&nbsp;think our family is&nbsp;<strong>complete</strong>.”</p><p>Family has become a&nbsp;priority for Sandra. We&nbsp;hope they keep this balance and harmony and are thankful for this inspiring story that probably made other people consider adoption.</p><p>What’s the most difficult thing about adopting a&nbsp;child, in&nbsp;your opinion?
