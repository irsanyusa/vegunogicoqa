But it also comes with its own costs and burdens: when the water heater is broken, the kitchen needs refitting, and no toilet in the house will flush properly, the benefits of having a place to call your own can seem remote indeed.</p><p>Across all 17 markets featured in our study, just over half (53%) own their own house. Home ownership is highest in Singapore (65%) and Sweden (63%), and lowest in Germany (34%) and the UAE (32%), but in most of these countries, regions or areas, it’s more common to own your home than not.</p><p>When it comes to people who don’t own their own home, most want to: three-quarters (76%) say they want to have their own property in future, while 15% do not.</p><p>The dream of home ownership is especially potent in Indonesia (95%) and Mexico (94%); in both markets, just 2% do not aspire to have their own house someday. In other markets, it’s a more mixed story. People who don’t have property generally aspire to it – but the degree varies heavily, especially within Europe. While 84% of Spaniards want to own their own home, this falls to just two-thirds of Danes (66%), three in five French people (62%), and less than half of Germans (48%).</p><p>Germans are, by some distance, the group most likely to eschew home ownership: two in five (42%) say they have no intention of buying property. This may be due to the country’s anomalous housing policies, including higher real estate taxes, wide access to social housing, <a href=#>and a lack of mortgage interest deductions for owner-occupiers</a>.</p><p>So while Germany is an outlier, it is also an example of a country where housing policy has given people more reason to rent and less reason to want a house of their own. While there are sentimental reasons to buy a house, it’s also a practical decision influenced by the benefits accorded to homeowners by society. When those benefits don’t exist, interest in owning a house may drop significantly.</p><p aria-level=2 paraeid={f7370ec7-78e0-4ce9-8ed0-da826eab5690}{73} paraid=519889056 role=heading><strong>Receive monthly topical insights about the banking and insurance industry, straight to your inbox. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sign up today</a>.</strong></p><p paraeid={f7370ec7-78e0-4ce9-8ed0-da826eab5690}{88} paraid=2004531352><strong>Discover more <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">banking and insurance content</a> here</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksqS7zaiksmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhrZmuFd3nGpaabmZxixKm7jJ2mnqtdlrulecOonKympGLEorrTZqawpl2dvK6xnqucnaGimrC1q8WrpqZ1VWeTtbvPopqsXWJ7sqS7zaiksl1ie66zwMico56rXaeysbvRrapeanZnfXN9hGt9aW5VZ5NzhYRrfaCkn5eurXnWoaZmnJ%2BawG6tzZ1knaeVqLu1edaapa1ln6y7brTOppw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
